# The Lens That Sees Its Flaws

Light leaves the Sun and strikes your shoelaces and bounces off;
some photons enter the pupils of your eyes and strike your retina;
the energy of the photons triggers neural impulses; the neural
impulses are transmitted to the visual-processing areas of the
brain; and there the optical information is processed and
reconstructed into a 3D model that is recognized as an untied
shoelace; and so you believe that your shoelaces are untied.

Here is the secret of *deliberate rationality -* this whole
entanglement process is not
[magic](/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/), and
you can *understand* it.  You can *understand* how you see your
shoelaces.  You can *think* about which sort of thinking processes
will create beliefs which mirror reality, and which thinking
processes will not.

Mice can see, but they can't understand seeing.  *You* can
understand seeing, and because of that, you can do things which
mice cannot do.  Take a moment to
[marvel](/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/) at this, for it is
indeed marvelous.

Mice see, but they don't know they have visual cortexes, so they
can't correct for optical illusions.  A mouse lives in a mental
world that includes cats, holes, cheese and mousetraps - but not
mouse brains.  Their camera does not take pictures of its own
lens.  But we, as humans, can look at a
[seemingly bizarre image](http://www.richrock.com/gifs/optical-illusion-wheels-circles-rotating.png),
and realize that part of what we're seeing is the lens itself.  You
don't always have to believe your own eyes, but you have to realize
that you *have* eyes - you must have distinct mental buckets for
the map and the territory, for the senses and reality.  Lest you
think this a trivial ability, remember how rare it is in the animal
kingdom.

The whole idea of Science is, simply, reflective reasoning about a
more reliable process for making the contents of your mind mirror
the contents of the world.  It is the sort of thing mice would
never invent.  Pondering this business of "performing replicable
experiments to falsify theories", we can see *why* it works. 
Science is not a
[separate magisterium](/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/),
far away from real life and the understanding of ordinary mortals. 
Science is not something that only applies to the
[inside of laboratories](/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/).  Science,
itself, is an understandable process-in-the-world that correlates
brains with reality.

Science *makes sense,* when you think about it.  But mice can't
think about thinking, which is why they don't have Science.  One
should not overlook the wonder of this - or the potential power it
bestows on us as individuals, not just scientific societies.

Admittedly, understanding the engine of thought may be
*a little more complicated* than understanding a steam engine - but
it is not a *fundamentally* different task.

Once upon a time, I went to EFNet's \#philosophy to ask "Do you
believe a nuclear war will occur in the next 20 years?  If no, why
not?"  One person who answered the question said he didn't expect a
nuclear war for 100 years, because "All of the players involved in
decisions regarding nuclear war are not interested right now." 
"But why extend that out for 100 years?", I asked. "Pure hope," was
his reply.

Reflecting on this whole thought process, we can see why the
thought of nuclear war makes the person unhappy, and we can see how
his brain therefore rejects the belief.  But, if you imagine a
billion worlds - Everett branches, or
[Tegmark duplicates](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302131) - this
thought process will not
[systematically correlate](/lw/jl/what_is_evidence/) optimists to
branches in which no nuclear war occurs.  (Some clever fellow is
bound to say, "Ah, but since I have hope, I'll work a little harder
at my job, pump up the global economy, and thus help to prevent
countries from sliding into the angry and hopeless state where
nuclear war is a possibility.  So the two events are related after
all."  At this point, we have to drag in
[Bayes's Theorem](http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html) and
measure the charge of entanglement quantitatively.  Your optimistic
nature cannot have *that* large an effect on the world; it cannot,
of itself, decrease the probability of nuclear war by 20%, or
however much your optimistic nature shifted your beliefs.  Shifting
your beliefs by a large amount, due to an event that only carries a
very tiny charge of entanglement, will still mess up your
mapping.)

To ask which beliefs make you happy, is to turn inward, not outward
- it tells you something about yourself, but it is not evidence
entangled with the environment.  I have nothing anything against
happiness, but it should [follow from](/lw/hp/feeling_rational/)
your picture of the world, rather than tampering with the mental
paintbrushes.

If you can see this - if you can see that hope is shifting your
*first-order* thoughts by too large a degree - if you can
understand your mind as a mapping-engine with flaws in it - then
you can apply a reflective correction.  The brain is a flawed lens
through which to see reality.  This is true of both mouse brains
and human brains.  But a human brain is a flawed lens that can
understand its own flaws - its systematic errors, its biases - and
apply second-order corrections to them.  This, *in practice,* makes
the flawed lens far more powerful.  Not perfect, but far more
powerful.
