  <div><p><strong>Followup to:</strong>&#xA0; <a href="/lw/jl/what_is_evidence/">What is Evidence?</a></p>
<p><a href="/lw/jl/what_is_evidence/">Previously</a>, I defined <em>evidence</em> as "an event entangled, by links of cause and effect, with whatever you want to know about", and <em>entangled</em> as "happening differently for different possible states of the target".&#xA0; So how much entanglement - how much evidence - is required to support a belief?</p>
<p>Let's start with a question simple enough to be mathematical: how hard would you have to entangle yourself with the <a href="/lw/hl/lotteries_a_waste_of_hope/">lottery</a> in order to win?&#xA0; Suppose there are seventy balls, drawn without replacement, and six numbers to match for the win.&#xA0; Then there are 131,115,985 possible winning combinations, hence a randomly selected ticket would have a 1/131,115,985 probability of winning (0.0000007%).&#xA0; To win the lottery, you would need evidence <em>selective</em> enough to visibly favor one combination over 131,115,984 alternatives.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Suppose there are some tests you can perform which
discriminate, probabilistically, between winning and losing lottery numbers.&#xA0; For example,
you can punch a combination into a little black box that always beeps if the combination is the winner, and has only a 1/4 (25%) chance of beeping if the combination is wrong.&#xA0; In <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html">Bayesian</a> terms, we would say the <em>likelihood
ratio</em> is 4 to 1.&#xA0; This means that the box is 4 times as likely to beep when we punch in a correct combination, compared to how likely it is to beep for an incorrect combination.</p>
<p>There are still a whole lot of possible combinations.&#xA0; If you punch in 20 incorrect combinations, the box will beep on 5 of them by sheer chance (on average).&#xA0; If you punch in all 131,115,985 possible combinations, then while the box is certain to beep for the one winning combination, it will also beep for 32,778,996 losing combinations (on average).</p>
<p>So this box doesn't let you win the lottery, but it's better than nothing.&#xA0; If you used the box, your odds of winning would go from 1 in 131,115,985 to 1 in 32,778,997.&#xA0; You've made some progress toward finding your target, the truth, within the huge space of possibilities.</p>
<p>Suppose you can use another black box to test combinations <em>twice,</em> <em>independently.</em>&#xA0; Both boxes are certain to beep for the winning ticket.&#xA0; But the chance of a box beeping for a losing combination is 1/4 <em>independently</em> for each box; hence the chance of <em>both</em> boxes beeping for a losing combination is 1/16.&#xA0; We can say that the <em>cumulative</em> evidence, of two independent tests, has a likelihood ratio of 16:1.&#xA0; The number of losing lottery tickets that pass both tests will be (on average) 8,194,749.</p>
<p>Since there are 131,115,985 possible lottery tickets, you might guess that you need evidence whose strength is around 131,115,985 to 1 - an event, or series of events, which is 131,115,985 times more likely to happen for a winning combination than a losing combination.&#xA0; Actually, this amount of evidence would only be enough to give you an <em>even</em> chance of winning the lottery.&#xA0; Why?&#xA0; Because if you apply a filter of that power to 131 million losing tickets, there will be, on average, one losing ticket that passes the filter.&#xA0; The winning ticket will also pass the filter.&#xA0; So you'll be left with two tickets that passed the filter, only one of them a winner.&#xA0; 50% odds of winning, if you can only buy one ticket.</p>
<p>A better way of viewing the problem:&#xA0; In the beginning, there is 1 winning ticket and 131,115,984 losing tickets, so your odds of winning are 1:131,115,984.&#xA0; If you use a single box, the odds of it beeping are 1 for a winning ticket and 0.25 for a losing ticket.&#xA0; So we multiply 1:131,115,984 by 1:0.25 and get 1:32,778,996.&#xA0; Adding another box of evidence multiplies the odds by 1:0.25 again, so now the odds are 1 winning ticket to 8,194,749 losing tickets.</p>
<p dragover="true">It is convenient to measure evidence in bits - not like bits on a hard drive, but mathematician's bits, which are conceptually different.&#xA0; Mathematician's bits are the logarithms, base 1/2, of probabilities.&#xA0; For example, if there are four possible outcomes A, B, C, and D, whose probabilities are 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 12.5%, and I tell you the outcome was "D", then I have transmitted three bits of information to you, because I informed you of an outcome whose probability was 1/8.</p>
<p dragover="true">It so happens that 131,115,984 is slightly less than 2 to the 27th power.&#xA0; So 14 boxes or 28 bits of evidence - an event 268,435,456:1 times more likely to happen if the ticket-hypothesis is true than if it is false - would shift the odds from 1:131,115,984 to 268,435,456:131,115,984, which reduces to 2:1.&#xA0; Odds of 2 to 1 mean two chances to win for each chance to lose, so the <em>probability</em> of winning with 28 bits of evidence is 2/3.&#xA0; Adding another box, another 2 bits of evidence, would take the odds to 8:1.&#xA0; Adding yet another two boxes would take the chance of winning to 128:1.</p>
<p dragover="true">So if you want to license a <em>strong belief</em> that you will win the lottery - arbitrarily defined as less than a 1% probability of being wrong - 34 bits of evidence about the winning combination should do the trick.</p>
<p dragover="true">In general, the rules for weighing "how much evidence it takes" follow a similar pattern:&#xA0; The larger the <em>space of possibilities</em> in which the hypothesis lies, or the more unlikely the hypothesis seems <em>a priori</em> compared to its neighbors, or the more confident you wish to be, the more evidence you need.</p>
<p dragover="true">You cannot defy the rules; you cannot form accurate beliefs based on inadequate evidence.&#xA0; Let's say you've got 10 boxes lined up in a row, and you start punching combinations into the boxes.&#xA0; You cannot stop on the first combination that gets beeps from all 10 boxes, saying, "But the odds of that happening for a losing combination are a million to one!&#xA0; I'll just ignore those ivory-tower Bayesian rules and stop here."&#xA0; On average, 131 losing tickets will pass such a test for every winner.&#xA0; Considering the space of possibilities and the prior improbability, you jumped to a too-strong conclusion based on insufficient evidence.&#xA0; That's not a pointless bureaucratic regulation, it's math.</p>
<p dragover="true">Of course, you can still <em>believe</em> based on inadequate evidence, if that is your whim; but you will not be able to believe <em>accurately.&#xA0; </em>It is like trying to drive your car without any fuel, because you don't believe in the silly-dilly fuddy-duddy concept that it ought to take fuel to go places.&#xA0; It would be so much more <em>fun,</em> and so much less expensive, if we just decided to repeal the law that cars need fuel.&#xA0; Isn't it just obviously better for everyone?&#xA0; Well, you can try, if that is your whim.&#xA0; You can even shut your eyes and pretend the car is moving.&#xA0; But to <em>really</em> arrive at accurate beliefs requires evidence-fuel, and the further you want to go, the more fuel you need. </p></div></div></div>
