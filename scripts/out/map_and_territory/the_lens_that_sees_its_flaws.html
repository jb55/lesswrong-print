<p>Light leaves the Sun and strikes your
shoelaces and bounces off; some photons enter the pupils of your eyes
and strike your retina; the energy of the photons triggers neural
impulses; the neural impulses are transmitted to the visual-processing
areas of the brain; and there the optical information is processed and
reconstructed into a 3D model that is recognized as an untied
shoelace; and so you believe that your shoelaces are untied.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here is the secret of <em>deliberate rationality -</em> this
whole entanglement process is not <a href="/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/">magic</a>, and you can <em>understand</em> it.&#xA0; You
can <em>understand</em> how you see your shoelaces.&#xA0; You can <em>think</em> about which sort
of thinking processes will create beliefs which mirror reality, and which
thinking processes will not.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mice can see, but they can't understand
seeing.&#xA0; <em>You</em> can understand seeing, and because of that, you can do
things which mice cannot do.&#xA0; Take a moment to <a href="/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/">marvel</a> at this, for it is indeed marvelous.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Mice see, but they don't know they have visual cortexes, so
they can't correct for optical illusions.&#xA0; A mouse lives in a mental world that includes cats, holes, cheese and mousetraps - but not mouse brains.&#xA0; Their camera does not take pictures of its own lens.&#xA0; But we, as humans, can look at a <a href="http://www.richrock.com/gifs/optical-illusion-wheels-circles-rotating.png">seemingly bizarre image</a>, and realize that part of what we're seeing is the lens itself.&#xA0; You don't always have to believe your own eyes, but you have to realize that you <em>have</em> eyes - you must have distinct mental buckets for the map and the territory, for the senses and reality.&#xA0; Lest you think this a trivial ability, remember how rare it is in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The whole idea of Science is, simply, reflective reasoning
about a more reliable process for making the contents of your mind mirror the
contents of the world.&#xA0; It is the sort of thing mice would never invent.&#xA0; Pondering this business of "performing replicable experiments to falsify
theories", we can see <em>why</em> it works.&#xA0; Science is not a
<a href="/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/">separate
magisterium</a>, far away from real life and the understanding of ordinary
mortals.&#xA0; Science is not something that only applies to the <a href="/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/">inside of
laboratories</a>.&#xA0; Science, itself, is an understandable
process-in-the-world that correlates brains with reality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Science <em>makes
sense,</em> when you think about it.&#xA0; But mice can't think about thinking, which is why they don't have Science.&#xA0; One should not overlook the wonder of this - or the potential power it bestows on us as individuals, not just scientific societies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Admittedly, understanding the engine of thought may be <em>a
little more complicated</em> than understanding a steam engine - but it is not a
<em>fundamentally</em> different task.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once upon a time, I went to EFNet's #philosophy to ask "Do you believe a nuclear war will occur in the next 20 years?&#xA0; If no, why not?"&#xA0; One person who answered the question said he didn't expect a nuclear war for 100 years, because "All of the players involved in decisions regarding nuclear war are not 
interested right now."&#xA0; "But why extend that out for 100 years?", I asked. 
 "Pure hope," was his reply.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Reflecting on this whole thought process, we can see why the thought of nuclear war makes the person unhappy, and we can see how his brain
therefore rejects the belief.&#xA0; But, if you imagine a billion worlds -
Everett branches, or <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302131">Tegmark
duplicates</a> - this thought process will not <a href="/lw/jl/what_is_evidence/">systematically correlate</a>
optimists to branches in which no nuclear war occurs.&#xA0; (Some clever fellow is bound to say, "Ah, but since I have hope, I'll work a little harder at my job,
pump up the global economy, and thus help to prevent countries from
sliding into the angry and hopeless state where nuclear war is a
possibility.&#xA0; So the two events are related after all."&#xA0; At this point, we have
to drag in <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html">Bayes's Theorem</a>
and measure the charge of entanglement quantitatively.&#xA0; Your optimistic nature cannot have <em>that</em> large an effect on the world; it cannot, of itself, decrease the probability of nuclear war by 20%, or however much your optimistic nature shifted your beliefs.&#xA0; Shifting your
beliefs by a large amount, due to an event that only carries a very
tiny charge of entanglement, will still mess up your mapping.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To ask which beliefs make you happy, is to turn inward, not
outward - it tells you something about yourself, but it is not evidence
entangled with the environment.&#xA0; I have nothing anything against happiness, but it should <a href="/lw/hp/feeling_rational/">follow from</a> your picture of the world, rather than tampering with the mental paintbrushes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you can see this - if you can see that hope is shifting your <em>first-order</em> thoughts by too large a degree - if you can understand your mind as a mapping-engine with flaws in it - then you can apply a reflective correction.&#xA0; The brain is a flawed lens through which to see reality.&#xA0; This is true of both mouse brains and human brains.&#xA0; But a human brain is a flawed lens that can understand its own flaws - its systematic errors, its biases - and apply second-order corrections to them.&#xA0; This, <em>in practice,</em> makes the flawed lens far more powerful.&#xA0; Not perfect, but far more powerful.</p>
