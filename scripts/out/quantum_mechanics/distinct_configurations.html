</em><strong>Previously in series</strong>:&#xA0; <a href="/lw/pe/joint_configurations/">Joint Configurations</a></p>
<p>Yesterday's experiment carried two key lessons:</p>
<p>First, we saw that because amplitude flows can cancel out, and because
our magic measure of squared modulus is not linear, the identity of
configurations is nailed down - you can't reorganize configurations the way you can regroup possible worlds.&#xA0; Which configurations are the same, and
which are distinct, has experimental consequences; it is an observable fact.</p>
<p>Second, we saw that configurations are about multiple particles.&#xA0; If there are two photons entering the apparatus, that doesn't mean there are two initial configurations.&#xA0; Instead the initial configuration's identity is "Two photons coming in."&#xA0; (Ideally, each configuration we talk about would include every particle in the experiment - including the particles making up the mirrors and detectors.&#xA0; And in the real universe, every configuration is about <em>all</em> the particles... <em>everywhere</em>.)</p>
<p>What makes for distinct configurations is not distinct particles.&#xA0; Each configuration is about every particle.&#xA0; What makes configurations distinct, is particles occupying different positions - at least one particle in a different state.</p>
<p>To take one important demonstration...</p><a id="more"></a><p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/11/fig5_2.gif"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/11/fig5_2.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title="Fig5_2" height="193" width="360" alt="Fig5_2" border="0"></a>
This is the same experiment as <a href="/lw/pd/configurations_and_amplitude/">Figure 2</a>,&#xA0; with one important change:&#xA0; Between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong> has been placed a sensitive thingy, <strong>S</strong>.&#xA0; The key attribute of <strong>S</strong> is that if a photon goes past <strong>S</strong>, <strong>S</strong> ends up in a slightly different state.</p>
<p>Let's say that the two possible states of <strong>S</strong> are <em>Yes</em> and <em>No</em>.&#xA0; <strong>S</strong> starts out in state <em>No</em>, and ends up in state <em>Yes</em> if a photon goes past.</p>
<p>Then the initial configuration is:</p><blockquote><p>"A photon heading toward <strong>A</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>No</em>."&#xA0; (-1 + 0<em>i</em>)</p></blockquote><p>Next, the action of the half-silvered mirror at <strong>A</strong>.&#xA0; In the <a href="/lw/pd/configurations_and_amplitude/">previous version of this experiment</a>, without the sensitive thingy, the two resultant configurations were "<strong>A</strong> to <strong>B</strong>" with amplitude -<em>i</em> and "<strong>A</strong> to <strong>C</strong>" with amplitude -1.&#xA0; Now, though, a new element has been introduced into the system, and all configurations are about all particles, and so every configuration mentions the new element.&#xA0; So the amplitude flows from the initial configuration are to:</p><blockquote><p>"Photon from <strong>A</strong> to <strong>B</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>No</em>."&#xA0; (0 + -<em>i</em>)<br>"Photon from <strong>A</strong> to <strong>C</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>Yes.</em>"&#xA0; (-1 + 0<em>i</em>)</p></blockquote><p>Next, the action of the full mirrors at <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Photon from <strong>B</strong> to <strong>D</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>No</em>."&#xA0; (1 + <em>0i</em>)<br>
"Photon from <strong>C</strong> to <strong>D</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>Yes.</em>"&#xA0; (0 + -<em>i</em>)</p></blockquote><p>And then the action of the half-mirror at <strong>D</strong>, on the amplitude flowing from both of the above configurations:</p>
<ol><li>"Photon from <strong>D</strong> to <strong>E</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>No</em>."&#xA0; (0 + <em>i</em>)</li>
<li>"Photon from <strong>D</strong> to <strong>F</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>No</em>."&#xA0; (1 + 0<em>i</em>)</li>
<li>"Photon from <strong>D</strong> to <strong>E</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>Yes.</em>"&#xA0; (0 + -<em>i</em>)</li>
<li>"Photon from <strong>D</strong> to <strong>F</strong>; and <strong>S</strong> in state <em>Yes.</em>"&#xA0; (1 + 0<em>i</em>)</li></ol>
<p>When we did this experiment without the sensitive thingy, the amplitude flows (1) and (3) of (0 + <em>i</em>) and (0 + -<em>i</em>) to the "<strong>D</strong> to <strong>E</strong>" configuration canceled each other out.&#xA0; We were left with no amplitude for a photon going to Detector 1 (way up at the experimental level, we never observe a photon striking Detector 1).</p>
<p>But in this case, the two amplitude flows (1) and (3) are now to distinct configurations; at least one entity, <strong>S</strong>, is in a different state between (1) and (3).&#xA0; The amplitudes don't cancel out.</p>
<p>When we wave our magical squared-modulus-ratio detector over the four final configurations, we find that the squared moduli of all are equal:&#xA0; 25% probability each.&#xA0; Way up at the level of the real world, we find that the photon has an equal chance of striking Detector 1 and Detector 2.</p>
<p>All the above is true, even if we, the researchers, don't care about the state of <strong>S</strong>.&#xA0; Unlike possible worlds, configurations cannot be regrouped on a whim.&#xA0; The laws of <em>physics</em> say the two configurations are distinct; it's not a question of how <em>we</em> can most conveniently parse up the world.</p>
<p>All the above is true, even if we don't bother to look at the state of <strong>S</strong>.&#xA0; The configurations (1) and (3) are distinct in physics, even if we don't know the distinction.</p>
<p>All the above is true, even if we don't know <strong>S</strong> exists.&#xA0; The configurations (1) and (3) are distinct whether or not <em>we</em> have distinct <em>mental representations</em> for the two possibilities.</p>
<p dragover="true">All the above is true, even if we're in space, and <strong>S</strong> transmits a new photon off toward the interstellar void in two distinct directions, depending on whether the photon of interest passed it or not.&#xA0; So that we couldn't <em>ever</em> find out whether <strong>S</strong> had been in <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em>.&#xA0; The state of <strong>S</strong> would be embodied in the photon transmitted off to nowhere.&#xA0; The lost photon can be an <a href="/lw/pb/belief_in_the_implied_invisible/">implied invisible</a>, and the state of <strong>S</strong> pragmatically undetectable; but the configurations are still distinct.</p>
<p dragover="true">(The main reason it <em>wouldn't</em> work, is if <strong>S</strong> were nudged, but <strong>S</strong> had an original spread in configuration space that was larger than the nudge.&#xA0; Then you couldn't rely on the nudge to separate the amplitude distribution over configuration space into distinct lumps.&#xA0; In reality, all this takes place within a differentiable amplitude distribution over a continuous configuration space.)</p>
<p dragover="true">Configurations are not belief states.&#xA0; Their distinctness is an objective fact with experimental consequences.&#xA0; The configurations are distinct even if no one knows the state of <strong>S</strong>; distinct even if no intelligent entity can ever find out.&#xA0; The configurations are distinct so long as at least <em>one particle</em> in the universe <em>anywhere</em> is in a different position.&#xA0; This is experimentally demonstrable.</p>
<p dragover="true">Why am I emphasizing this?&#xA0; Because back in the dark ages when no one understood quantum physics...</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/11/fig2_2.gif"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/11/fig2_2.gif" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: right;" title="Fig2_2" height="144" width="270" alt="Fig2_2" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>Okay, so imagine that you've got no clue what's really going on, and you try the experiment in Figure 2, and no photons show up at Detector 1.&#xA0; Cool.</p>
<p>You also discover that when you put a block between <strong>B</strong> and <strong>D</strong>, <em>or</em> a block between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong>, photons show up at Detector 1 and Detector 2 in equal proportions.&#xA0; But only one at a time - Detector 1 or Detector 2 goes off, not both simultaneously.</p>
<p>So, yes, it <em>does </em>seem to you like you're dealing with a particle - the photon is only in one place at one time, every time <em>you </em>see it (we'll talk about the <em>real</em> reasons for this later).</p>
<p>And yet there's some kind of... <em>mysterious phenomenon...</em> that prevents the photon from showing up in Detector 1.&#xA0; And this mysterious phenomenon depends on the photon being <em>able</em> to go both ways.&#xA0; Even though the photon only shows up in one detector or the other, which shows, <em>you would think,</em> that the photon is only in one place at a time.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/11/fig3_2.gif"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/11/fig3_2.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title="Fig3_2" height="151" width="270" alt="Fig3_2" border="0"></a>
Which makes the whole pattern of the experiments seem pretty bizarre!&#xA0; &#xA0;After all, the photon either goes from <strong>A</strong> to <strong>C</strong>, or from <strong>A</strong> to <strong>B</strong>; one or the other.&#xA0; (Or so you would think, if you were instinctively trying to break reality down into individually real particles.)&#xA0; But when you block off one course or the other, you start getting different experimental results!</p>
<p>It's like the photon wants to be <em>allowed</em> to go both ways, even though (you would think) it only goes one way or the other.&#xA0; And it can <em>tell</em> if you try to block it off, without actually <span style="font-style: italic;">going</span><em> there</em> - if it'd gone there, it would have run into the block, and not hit any detector at all.<strong>&#xA0;</strong> </p>
<p>It's as if mere <em>possibilities</em> could have causal effects, in defiance of what the word "real" is usually thought to <em>mean</em>...<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p>But it's a bit early to jump to conclusions like <em>that</em>, when you don't have a complete picture of what goes on inside the experiment.</p>
<p dragover="true"><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/11/fig5_4.gif"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/11/fig5_4.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title="Fig5_4" height="144" width="270" alt="Fig5_4" border="0"></a> So it occurs to you to put a sensor between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong>, so you can tell which way the photon <em>really</em> goes on each occasion.</p>
<p dragover="true">And the mysterious phenomenon goes away.</p>
<p dragover="true">I mean, now how crazy is that?&#xA0; What kind of paranoia does that inspire in some poor scientist?</p>
<p dragover="true">Okay, so in the 21st century we realize in order to "know" a photon's history, the particles making up your brain <a href="/lw/o5/the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_and_engines_of/">have to be correlated</a> with the photon's history.&#xA0; If having a tiny little sensitive thingy <strong>S</strong> that correlates to the photon's history, is enough to distinguish the final configurations and prevent the amplitude flows from canceling; then an entire sensor with a digital display, never mind a human brain, will put <em>septillions </em>of particles in different positions and prevent the amplitude flows from canceling.</p>
<p dragover="true">But if you hadn't worked that out yet...</p>
<p dragover="true">Then you would ponder the sensor having banished the Mysterious Phenomenon, and think:</p>
<p>The photon doesn't just want to be <em>physically</em> free to go either way.&#xA0; It's not a little wave going along an unblocked pathway, because then just having a physically unblocked pathway would be enough.</p>
<p>No... I'm not allowed to <em>know</em> which way the photon went.</p>
<p>The mysterious phenomenon... <em>doesn't want me looking at it too closely</em>... while it's doing its mysterious thing.</p>
<p>It's not <em>physical possibilities</em> that have an effect on reality... only <em>epistemic possibilities.</em>&#xA0; If I <em>know</em> which way the photon went, it's no longer <em>plausible </em>that it went the other way... which cuts off the mysterious phenomenon as effectively as putting a block between <strong>B</strong> and <strong>D</strong>.</p>
<p>I have to <em>not observe</em> which way the photon went, in order for it to always end up at Detector 2.&#xA0; It has to be <em>reasonable </em>that the photon could have gone to either <strong>B</strong> or <strong>C</strong>.&#xA0; What I can <em>know</em> is the determining factor, regardless of which physical paths I leave open or closed.</p>
<p>STOP THE PRESSES!&#xA0; MIND IS FUNDAMENTAL AFTER ALL!&#xA0; CONSCIOUS AWARENESS DETERMINES OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS!</p>
<p>You can <em>still read</em> this kind of stuff.&#xA0; In <em>physics textbooks.</em>&#xA0; Even now, when a majority of theoretical physicists know better.&#xA0; Stop the presses.&#xA0; Please, stop the presses.</p>
<p><a href="/lw/il/hindsight_bias/">Hindsight is 20/20</a>; and so it's easy to say that, in hindsight, there were certain clues that this interpretation was not correct.</p>
<p>Like, if you put the sensor between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong> <em>but don't read it</em>, the mysterious phenomenon <em>still</em> goes away, and the photon still sometimes ends up at Detector 1.&#xA0; (Oh, but you <em>could</em> have read it, and possibilities are real now...)</p>
<p>But it doesn't even have to be a <em>sensor,</em> a scientific instrument that you built.&#xA0; A single particle that gets nudged far enough will dispel the interference.&#xA0; A photon radiating off to where you'll never see it again can do the trick.&#xA0; Not much human involvement there.&#xA0; Not a whole lot of conscious awareness.</p>
<p>Maybe before you pull the dualist fire alarm on human brains being physically special, you should provide experimental proof that a rock can't play the same role in dispelling the Mysterious Phenomenon as a human researcher?</p>
<p>But that's hindsight, and it's easy to call the shots in hindsight.&#xA0; Do you <em>really</em> think you could've done better than John von Neumann, if you'd been alive at the time?&#xA0; The point of this kind of <a href="/lw/h6/chronophone_motivations/">retrospective analysis</a> is to ask what kind of <a dragover="true" href="/lw/h5/archimedess_chronophone/">fully general clues</a> you could have followed, and whether there are any similar clues you're ignoring now on current mysteries.</p>
<p>Though it <em>is</em> a little embarrassing that, even <em>after</em> the theory of amplitudes and configurations had been worked out - with the theory now giving the definite prediction that any nudged particle would do the trick - early scientists <em>still</em> didn't get it.</p>
<p>But you see... it had been established as Common Wisdom that configurations were possibilities, it was epistemic possibility that mattered, amplitudes were a very strange sort of partial information, and conscious observation made quantumness go away.&#xA0; And that it was best to avoid thinking too hard about the whole business, so long as your experimental predictions came out right.</p></div></div></div>
