<p>Once upon a time, there was an alien species, whose planet hovered in the void of a universe with laws almost like our own.&#xA0; They would have been alien to us, but of course they did not think of <em>themselves</em> as alien.&#xA0; They communicated via rapid flashes of light, rather than sound.&#xA0; We'll call them the Ebborians.</p>
<p>Ebborians reproduce by fission, an adult dividing into two new individuals.&#xA0; They share genetic material, but not through sexual recombination; Ebborian adults swap genetic material with each other.&#xA0; They have two eyes, four legs, and two hands, letting a fissioned Ebborian survive long enough to regrow.</p>
<p>Human DNA is built in a double helix; unzipping the helix a little at a
time produces two stretches of single strands of DNA.&#xA0; Each single
strand attracts complementary bases, producing a new double strand.&#xA0; At
the end of the operation, a DNA double helix has turned into two double
helices.&#xA0; Hence earthly life.</p>
<p>Ebborians fission their brains, as well as their bodies, by a process something like how human DNA divides.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Imagine an Ebborian brain as a flat sheet of paper, computing in a way that is more electrical than chemical - charges flowing down conductive pathways.</p>
<p>When it's time for an Ebborian to fission, the brain-paper splits down its thickness into two sheets of paper.&#xA0; Each new sheet is capable of conducting electricity on its own.&#xA0; Indeed, the Ebborian(s) stays conscious throughout the whole fissioning process.&#xA0; Over time, the brain-paper grows thick enough to fission again.</p>
<p>Electricity flows through Ebborian brains faster than
human neurons fire.&#xA0; But the Ebborian brain is constrained by its
two-dimensionality.&#xA0; An Ebborian brain-paper must split down its thickness while retaining the integrity of its program.&#xA0; Ebborian evolution took the cheap way out: the brain-paper computes in a purely two-dimensional way.&#xA0; The Ebborians have much faster
neuron-equivalents, but they are far less interconnected.</p>
<p>On the whole, Ebborians
think faster than humans and remember less.&#xA0; They are less susceptible
to habit; they recompute what we would <a href="/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/">cache</a>.&#xA0; They would be incredulous at the idea that a human neuron might be connected to a thousand neighbors, and equally incredulous at the idea that our axons and dendrites propagate signals at only a few meters per second.</p>
<p dragover="true">The Ebborians have no concept of parents, children, or sexuality.&#xA0; Every adult Ebborian remembers fissioning many times.&#xA0; But Ebborian memories quickly fade if not used; no one knows the last common ancestor of those now alive.</p>
<p dragover="true">In principle, an Ebborian personality can be immortal.&#xA0; Yet an Ebborian remembers less life than a seventy-year-old human.&#xA0; They retain only the most important highlights of their last few millennia.&#xA0; Is this immortality?&#xA0; Is it death?<br>
</p>
<p>The Ebborians had to rediscover natural selection from scratch, because no one retained their memories of being a fish.</p>
<p dragover="true">But I digress from my tale.</p>
<p dragover="true">Today, the Ebborians have gathered to celebrate a day which all present will remember for hundreds of years.&#xA0; They have discovered (they believe) the Ultimate Grand Unified Theory of Everything for their universe.&#xA0; The theory which seems, at last, to explain every known <em>fundamental </em>physical phenomenon - to predict what every instrument will measure, in every experiment whose initial conditions are exactly known, and which can be calculated on available computers.</p>
<p>"But wait!" cries an Ebborian.&#xA0; (We'll call this one Po'mi.)&#xA0; "But wait!", cries Po'mi, "There are still questions the Unified Theory can't answer!&#xA0; During the fission process, when <em>exactly</em> does <em>one</em> Ebborian consciousness become <em>two</em> separate people?"</p>
<p>The gathered Ebborians look at each other.&#xA0; Finally, there speaks the moderator of the gathering, the second-foremost Ebborian on the planet: the much-respected Nharglane of Ebbore, who achieved his position through consistent gentleness and courtesy.</p>
<p>"Well," Nharglane says, "I admit I can't answer that one - but is it really a question of <em>fundamental</em> physics?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't even call that a 'question'," snorts De'da the Ebborian, "seeing as how there's no experimental test whose result depends on the answer."</p>
<p>"On the contrary," retorts Po'mi, "all our experimental results ultimately come down to our <em>experiences.</em>&#xA0; If a theory of physics can't predict what we'll experience, what good is it?"</p>
<p>De'da shrugs.&#xA0; "One person, two people - how does that make a difference even to <em>experience?</em>&#xA0; How do you tell even <em>internally </em>whether you're one person or two people?&#xA0; Of course, if you look over and see your other self, you know you're finished dividing - but by that time your brain has long since finished splitting."</p>
<p>"Clearly," says Po'mi, "at any given point, <em>whatever</em> is having an experience is one person.&#xA0; So it is never necessary to tell whether you are one person or two people.&#xA0; <em>You</em> are always one person.&#xA0; But at any given time during the split, does there exist another, <em>different</em> consciousness as yet, with its own awareness?"</p>
<p>De'da performs an elaborate quiver, the Ebborian equivalent of waving one's hands.&#xA0; "When the brain splits, it splits fast enough that there isn't much time where the question would be ambiguous.&#xA0; One instant, all the electrical charges are moving as a whole.&#xA0; The next instant, they move separately."</p>
<p>"That's not true," says Po'mi.&#xA0; "You can't sweep the problem under the rug that easily.&#xA0; There is a quite appreciable time - many picoseconds - when the two halves of the brain are within distance for the moving electrical charges in each half to tug on the other.&#xA0; Not quite causally separated, and not quite the same computation either.&#xA0; Certainly there is a time when there is definitely one person, and a time when there is definitely two people.&#xA0; But at which <em>exact</em> point in between are there two distinct conscious experiences?"</p>
<p>"My challenge stands," says De'da.&#xA0; "How does it make a difference, even a difference of <em>first-person</em> experience, as to <em>when</em> you say the split occurs?&#xA0; There's no third-party experiment you can perform to tell you the answer.&#xA0; And no difference of first-person experience, either.&#xA0; Your belief that consciousness must 'split' at some particular point, stems from trying to model consciousness as a big rock of awareness that can only be in one place at a time.&#xA0; There's no third-party experiment, and no first-person experience, that can tell you when you've split; the question is meaningless."</p>
<p>"If experience is meaningless," retorts Po'mi, "then so are all our scientific theories, which are merely intended to <em>explain</em> our experiences."</p>
<p>"If I may," says another Ebborian, named Yu'el, "I think I can refine my honorable colleague Po'mi's dilemma.&#xA0; Suppose that you anesthetized one of us -"</p>
<p>(Ebborians use an anesthetic that effectively shuts off electrical power to the brain - no processing or learning occurs while an Ebborian is anesthetized.)</p>
<p>"- and then flipped a coin.&#xA0; If the coin comes up heads, you split the subject while they are unconscious.&#xA0; If the coin comes up tails, you leave the subject as is.&#xA0; When the subject goes to sleep, should they anticipate a 2/3 probability of seeing the coin come up heads, or anticipate a 1/2 probability of seeing the coin come up heads?&#xA0; If you answer 2/3, then there is a difference of anticipation that <em>could</em> be made to depend on exactly when you split."</p>
<p>"Clearly, then," says De'da, "the answer is 1/2, since answering 2/3 gets us into paradoxical and ill-defined issues."</p>
<p>Yu'el looks thoughtful.&#xA0; "What if we split you into 512 parts while you were anesthetized?&#xA0; Would you still answer a probability of 1/2 for seeing the coin come up heads?"</p>
<p>De'da shrugs.&#xA0; "Certainly.&#xA0; When I went to sleep, I would figure on a 1/2 probability that I wouldn't get split at all."</p>
<p>"Hmm..." Yu'el says.&#xA0; "All right, suppose that we are definitely going to split you into 16 parts.&#xA0; 3 of you will wake up in a red room, 13 of you will wake up in a green room.&#xA0; Do you anticipate a 13/16 probability of waking up in a green room?"</p>
<p>"I anticipate waking up in a green room with near-1 probability," replies De'da, "and I anticipate waking up in a red room with near-1 probability.&#xA0; My future selves will experience both outcomes."</p>
<p>"But I'm asking about your <em>personal</em> anticipation," Yu'el persists.&#xA0; "When you fall asleep, how much do you <em>anticipate</em> seeing a green room?&#xA0; You can't see both room colors at once - that's not an experience anyone will have - so which color do you personally anticipate more?"</p>
<p>De'da shakes his head.&#xA0; "I can see where this is going; you plan to ask what I anticipate in cases where I may or may not be split.&#xA0; But I must deny that your question has an objective answer, precisely <em>because </em>of where it leads.&#xA0; Now, I do say to you, that I <em>care</em> about my future selves.&#xA0; If you ask me whether I would like each of my green-room selves, or each of my red-room selves, to receive ten dollars, I will of course choose the green-roomers - but I don't care to follow this notion of 'personal anticipation' where you are taking it."</p>
<p>"While you are anesthetized," says Yu'el, "I will flip a coin; if the coin comes up heads, I will put 3 of you into red rooms and 13 of you into green rooms.&#xA0; If the coin comes up tails, I will reverse the proportion.&#xA0; If you wake up in a green room, what is your <em>posterior probability</em> that the coin came up heads?"</p>
<p>De'da pauses.&#xA0; "Well..." he says slowly, "Clearly, some of me will be wrong, no matter which reasoning method I use - but if you offer me a bet, I can minimize the number of me who bet <em>poorly</em>, by using the general policy, of each self <em>betting as if</em> the posterior probability of their color dominating is 13/16.&#xA0; And if you try to make <em>that</em> judgment depend on the details of the splitting process, then it just depends on how whoever <em>offers the bet</em> counts Ebborians."</p>
<p>Yu'el nods.&#xA0; "I can see what you are saying, De'da.&#xA0; But I just can't make myself believe it, at least not yet.&#xA0; If there were to be 3 of me waking up in red rooms, and a billion of me waking up in green rooms, I would quite strongly <em>anticipate</em> seeing a green room when I woke up.&#xA0; Just the same way that I anticipate <em>not</em> winning the lottery.&#xA0; And if the proportions of three red to a billion green, followed from a coin coming up heads; but the reverse proportion, of a billion red to three green, followed from tails; and I woke up and saw a red room; why, then, I would be nearly <em>certain</em> - on a quite personal level - that the coin had come up tails."</p>
<p>"That stance exposes you to quite a bit of trouble," notes De'da.</p>
<p>Yu'el nods.&#xA0; "I can even see some of the troubles myself.&#xA0; Suppose you split brains only a short distance apart from each other, so that they could, in principle, be <em>fused back together again?</em>&#xA0; What if there was an Ebborian with a brain thick enough to be split into a million parts, and the parts could then re-unite?&#xA0; Even if it's not biologically possible, we could do it with a computer-based mind, someday.&#xA0; Now, suppose you split me into 500,000 brains who woke up in green rooms, and 3 much thicker brains who woke up in red rooms.&#xA0; I would surely anticipate seeing the green room.&#xA0; But most of me who see the green room will see nearly the same thing - different in tiny details, perhaps, enough to differentiate our experience, but such details are soon forgotten.&#xA0; So now suppose that my 500,000 green selves are reunited into one Ebborian, and my 3 red selves are reunited into one Ebborian.&#xA0; Have I just sent nearly all of my "subjective probability" into the green future self, even though it is now only one of two?&#xA0; With only a little more work, you can see how a <em>temporary </em>expenditure of computing power, or a nicely refined brain-splitter and a dose of anesthesia, would let you have a high <em>subjective probability</em> of winning any lottery.&#xA0; At least any lottery that involved splitting you into pieces."</p>
<p>De'da furrows his eyes.&#xA0; "So have you not just proved your own theory to be nonsense?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure," says Yu'el.&#xA0; "At this point, I'm not even sure the conclusion is wrong."</p>
<p>"I didn't suggest your conclusion was <em>wrong,</em>" says De'da, "I suggested it was <em>nonsense.</em>&#xA0; There's a difference."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," says Yu'el.&#xA0; "Perhaps it will indeed turn out to be nonsense, when I know better.&#xA0; But if so, I don't quite know better <em>yet.</em>&#xA0; I can't quite see how to eliminate the notion of <em>subjective anticipation</em> from my view of the universe.&#xA0; I would need something to replace it, something to re-fill the <em>role</em> that anticipation currently plays in my worldview."</p>
<p>De'da shrugs.&#xA0; "Why not just eliminate 'subjective anticipation' outright?"</p>
<p>"For one thing," says Yu'el, "I would then have no way to express my surprise at the orderliness of the universe.&#xA0; Suppose you claimed that the universe was actually made up entirely of random experiences, brains temporarily coalescing from dust and experiencing all possible sensory data.&#xA0; Then if I don't count individuals, or weigh their existence <em>somehow</em>, that chaotic hypothesis would predict my existence as strongly as does science.&#xA0; The realization of all possible chaotic experiences would predict my own experience with probability 1.&#xA0; I need to keep my surprise at having <em>this particular</em> orderly experience, to justify my anticipation of seeing an orderly future.&#xA0; If I throw away the notion of subjective anticipation, then how do I differentiate the chaotic universe from the orderly one?&#xA0; Presumably there are Yu'els, somewhere in time and space (for the universe is spatially infinite) who are about to have a really chaotic experience.&#xA0; I need some way of saying that these Yu'els are <em>rare,</em> or <em>weigh little</em> - some way of <em>mostly </em>anticipating that I won't sprout wings and fly away.&#xA0; I'm not saying that my <em>current </em>way of doing this is good bookkeeping, or even <em>coherent</em> bookkeeping; but I can't just <em>delete</em> the bookkeeping without a more solid understanding to put in its place.&#xA0; I need some way to say that there are versions of me who see one thing, and versions of me who see something else, but there's <em>some</em> kind of different weight on them.&#xA0; Right now, what I try to do is count copies - but I don't know <em>exactly </em>what constitutes a copy."</p>
<p>Po'mi clears his throat, and speaks again.&#xA0; "So, Yu'el, you agree with me that there exists a definite and factual question as to exactly when there are two conscious experiences, instead of one."</p>
<p>"That, I do not concede," says Yu'el.&#xA0; "All that I have said may only be a recital of my own confusion.&#xA0; You are too quick to fix the language of your beliefs, when there are words in it that, by your own admission, you do not understand.&#xA0; No matter how fundamental your experience <em>feels </em>to you, it is not safe to <em>trust</em> that feeling, until experience is no longer something you are <em>confused</em> about.&#xA0; There is a black box here, a mystery.&#xA0; Anything could be inside that box - any sort of surprise - a shock that shatters everything you currently believe about consciousness.&#xA0; Including upsetting your belief that experience is fundamental.&#xA0; In fact, that strikes me as a surprise you should anticipate - though it will still come as a shock."</p>
<p>"But then," says Po'mi, "do you at least agree that if our physics does not specify <em>which</em> experiences are experienced, or how many of them, or how much they 'weigh', then our physics must
be incomplete?"</p>
<p>"No," says Yu'el, "I don't concede that either.&#xA0; Because consider that, even if a physics is <em>known</em> - even if we construct a universe with very simple physics, much simpler than our own Unified Theory - I can <em>still</em> present the same split-brain dilemmas, and they will still seem just as puzzling.&#xA0; This suggests that the source of the confusion is not in our theories of <em>fundamental </em>physics.&#xA0; It is on a higher level of organization.&#xA0; We can't compute exactly how proteins will fold up; but this is not a deficit in our theory of atomic dynamics, it is a deficit of computing power.&#xA0; We don't know what makes <em>sharkras </em>bloom only in spring; but this is not a deficit in our Unified Theory, it is a deficit in our biology - we don't possess the technology to take the <em>sharkras </em>apart on a molecular level to find out how they work.&#xA0; What you are pointing out is a gap in our science of consciousness, which would present us with just the same puzzles even if we knew <em>all</em> the fundamental physics.&#xA0; I see no work here for <em>physicists,</em> at all."</p>
<p>Po'mi smiles faintly at this, and is about to reply, when a listening Ebborian shouts, "What, have you begun to believe in zombies?&#xA0; That when you specify all the physical facts about a universe, there are facts about consciousness left over?"</p>
<p>"No!" says Yu'el.&#xA0; "Of course not!&#xA0; You can know the <em>fundamental</em> physics of a universe, hold all the <em>fundamental</em> equations in your mind, and still not have <em>all</em> the physical facts.&#xA0; You may not know why <em>sharkras </em>bloom in the summer.&#xA0; But if you could actually hold the entire fundamental physical state of the <em>sharkra </em>in your mind, and understand all its levels of organization, then you would necessarily know why it blooms - there would be no fact left over, from outside physics.&#xA0; When I say, 'Imagine running the split-brain experiment in a universe with simple known physics,' you are not <em>concretely</em> imagining that universe, in every detail.&#xA0; You are not <em>actually</em> specifying the entire physical makeup of an Ebborian in your imagination.&#xA0; You are only <em>imagining</em> that you know it.&#xA0; But if you <em>actually </em>knew how to build an entire conscious being from scratch, out of paperclips and rubberbands, you would have a <em>great deal</em> of knowledge that you do not presently have.&#xA0; This is <em>important</em> information that you are missing!&#xA0; <em>Imagining</em> that you have it, does not give you the insights that would follow from <em>really</em> knowing the full physical state of a conscious being."</p>
<p>"So," Yu'el continues, "We can <em>imagine</em> ourselves knowing the fundamental physics, and imagine an Ebborian brain splitting, and find that we don't know exactly when the consciousness has split.&#xA0; Because we are not <em>concretely</em> imagining a <em>complete and detailed</em> description of a conscious being, with full comprehension of the implicit higher levels of organization.&#xA0; There are knowledge gaps here, but they are not gaps of <em>physics.</em>&#xA0; They are gaps in our understanding of consciousness.&#xA0; I see no reason to think that <em>fundamental</em> physics has <em>anything to do with</em> such questions."</p>
<p>"Well then," Po'mi says, "I have a puzzle I should like you to explain, Yu'el.&#xA0; As you know, it was discovered not many years ago, that our universe has four spatial dimensions, rather than three dimensions, as it first appears."</p>
<p>"Aye," says Nharglane of Ebbore, "this was a key part in our working-out of the Unified Theory.&#xA0; Our models would be utterly at a loss to account for observed experimental results, if we could not model the fourth dimension, and differentiate the fourth-dimensional density of materials."</p>
<p>"And we also discovered," continues Po'mi, "that our very planet of Ebbore, including all the people on it, has a four-dimensional thickness, and is constantly fissioning along that thickness, just as our brains do.&#xA0; Only the fissioned sides of our planet do not remain in contact, as our new selves do; the sides separate into the fourth-dimensional void."</p>
<p>Nharglane nods.&#xA0; "Yes, it was rather a surprise to realize that the whole <em>world</em> is duplicated over and over.&#xA0; I shall remember that realization for a long time indeed.&#xA0; It is a good thing we Ebborians had our experience with self-fissioning, to prepare us for the shock.&#xA0; Otherwise we might have been driven mad, and embraced absurd physical theories."</p>
<p>"Well," says Po'mi, "when the world splits down its four-dimensional thickness, it does not always split exactly evenly.&#xA0; Indeed, it is not uncommon to see nine-tenths of the four-dimensional thickness in one side."</p>
<p>"Really?" says Yu'el.&#xA0; "My knowledge of physics is not so great as yours, but -"</p>
<p>"The statement is correct," says the respected Nharglane of Ebbore.</p>
<p>"Now," says Po'mi, "if fundamental physics has nothing to do with consciousness, can you tell me why the subjective probability of finding ourselves in a side of the split world, should be exactly proportional to the square of the thickness of that side?"</p>
<p>There is a great terrible silence.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" says Yu'el.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" says De'da.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" says Nharglane.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" says the entire audience of Ebborians.</p>
