<p>When we last met our heroes, the Ebborians, they were discussing the known phenomenon in which the entire planet of Ebbore and all its people splits down its fourth-dimensional thickness into two sheets, just like an individual Ebborian brain-sheet splitting along its third dimension.</p>
<p>And Po'mi has just asked:</p><blockquote><p>"Why should the subjective probability of finding ourselves in a side
of the split world, be exactly proportional to the square of the
thickness of that side?"</p></blockquote><a id="more"></a><p>When the initial hubbub quiets down, the respected Nharglane of Ebbore asks:&#xA0; "Po'mi, what is it <em>exactly</em> that you found?"</p>
<p>"Using instruments of the type we are all familiar with," Po'mi explains, "I determined when a splitting of the world was about to take place, and in what proportions the world would split.&#xA0; I found that I could not predict <em>exactly</em> which world I would find myself in -"</p>
<p>"Of course not," interrupts De'da, "you found yourself in <em>both</em> worlds, every time -"</p>
<p>"- but I could predict <em>probabilistically</em> which world I would find myself in.&#xA0; Out of all the times the world was about to split 2:1, into a side of two-thirds width and a side of one-third width, I found myself on the thicker side around 4 times out of 5, and on the thinner side around 1 time out of 5.&#xA0; When the world was about to split 3:1, I found myself on the thicker side 9 times out of 10, and on the thinner side 1 time out of 10."</p>
<p>"Are you <em>very sure</em> of this?" asks Nharglane.&#xA0; "How much data did you gather?"</p>
<p>Po'mi offers an overwhelming mountain of experimental evidence.</p>
<p>"I guess that settles that," mutters Nharglane.</p>
<p>"So you see," Po'mi says, "you were right after all, Yu'el, not to eliminate 'subjective probability' from your worldview.&#xA0; For if we do not have a 4/5 subjective anticipation of <em>continuing into</em> the thicker side of a 2:1 split, then how could we even <em>describe</em> this rule?"</p>
<p>"A good question," says De'da.&#xA0; "There ought to be <em>some</em> way of phrasing your discovery, which eliminates this problematic concept of 'subjective continuation'..."</p>
<p>The inimitable Ha'ro speaks up:&#xA0; "You might say that we find ourselves in a world in which the <em>remembered</em> splits obey the squared-thickness rule, to within the limits of statistical expectation."</p>
<p>De'da smiles.&#xA0; "Yes, excellent!&#xA0; That describes the evidence in terms of recorded experimental results, which seems less problematic than this 'subjective anticipation' business."</p>
<p>"Does that really buy us anything...?" murmurs Yu'el.&#xA0; "We're not limited to memories; we could perform the experiment again.&#xA0; What, on that next occasion, would you <em>anticipate</em> as your experimental result?&#xA0; If the thickness is split a hundred to one?&#xA0; Afterward it will be only a memory... but what about beforehand?"</p>
<p>"I think," says De'da, "that you have forgotten one of your own cardinal rules, Yu'el.&#xA0; Surely, what you <em>anticipate</em> is part of your map, not the territory.&#xA0; Your degree of anticipation is partial information you possess; it is not a substance of the experiment itself."</p>
<p>Yu'el pauses.&#xA0; "Aye, that is one of my cardinal rules... but I like my partial information to be <em>about</em> something.&#xA0; Before I can distinguish the map and the territory, I need a concept of the territory.&#xA0; What is my subjective anticipation <em>about</em>, in this case?&#xA0; I will <em>in fact</em> end up in both world-sides.&#xA0; I can calculate a certain probability to five decimal places, and verify it experimentally - but what is it a probability <em>of?</em>"</p>
<p>"I know!" shouts Bo'ma.&#xA0; "It's the probability that your <em>original</em> self ends up on that world-side!&#xA0; The other person is <em>just a copy!</em>"</p>
<p>A great groan goes up from the assembled Ebborians.&#xA0; "Not this again," says De'da.&#xA0; "Didn't we settle this during the Identity Wars?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Yu'el says.&#xA0; "There is no copy: there are two originals."</p>
<p>De'da shakes his head in disgust.&#xA0; "And what are the odds that, out of umpteen billion split Ebbores, <em>we</em> would be the originals at this point?"</p>
<p>"But you can't deny," Bo'ma says smugly, "that my theory produces good experimental predictions!&#xA0; It explains our observations, and that's all you can ask of any theory.&#xA0; And so science vindicates the Army of Original Warriors - we were right all along!"</p>
<p>"Hold on," says Yu'el.&#xA0; "That theory doesn't actually <em>explain</em> anything.&#xA0; At all."</p>
<p>"What?" says Bo'ma.&#xA0; "Of course it does.&#xA0; I use it daily to make experimental predictions; though <em>you</em> might not understand that part, not being a physicist."</p>
<p>Yu'el raises an eye.&#xA0; "<a href="/lw/ip/fake_explanations/">Failure to explain anything</a> is a hard-to-notice phenomenon in scientific theories.&#xA0; <a href="/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/">You have to pay close attention</a>, or you'll miss it.&#xA0; It was once thought that <a href="/lw/is/fake_causality/">phlogiston theory</a> predicted that wood, when burned, would lose phlogiston and transform into ash; and predicted that candles, burning in an enclosed space, would saturate the air with phlogiston and then go out.&#xA0; But these were not <em>advance</em> predictions of phlogiston theory.&#xA0; Rather, phlogiston theorists saw those results, and then said 'Phlogiston did it.'&#xA0; Now why didn't people notice this right away?&#xA0; Because that sort of thing is actually surprisingly hard to notice."</p>
<p>"In this case," continues Yu'el, "you have given us a rule that the <em>original</em> Ebborian has a probability of ending up in a world-side, which is proportional to the squared thickness of the side.&#xA0; We originally had the mystery of where the squared-thickness rule came from.&#xA0; And now that you've offered us your rule, we have <a href="/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/">the <em>exact same mystery</em> as before</a>.&#xA0; <em>Why</em> would each world have a squared-thickness probability of receiving the original?&#xA0; Why wouldn't the original consciousness <em>always</em> go to the thicker world?&#xA0; Or go with probability <em>directly</em> proportional to thickness, instead of the square?&#xA0; And what does it even <em>mean</em> to be the original?"</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter," retorts Bo'ma.&#xA0; "Let the equation <em>mean</em> anything it likes, so long as it gives good experimental predictions.&#xA0; What is the meaning of an electrical charge?&#xA0; Why is it an electrical charge?&#xA0; That doesn't matter; only the numbers matter.&#xA0; My law that the original ends up in a particular side, with probability equaling the square of its thickness, gives good numbers.&#xA0; End of story."</p>
<p>Yu'el shakes his head.&#xA0; "When I look over the raw structure of your theory - the computer program that would correspond to this model - it contains a strictly superfluous element.&#xA0; You have to compute the square of the thickness, and turn it into a probability, in order to get <em>the chance that the original self goes there.</em>&#xA0; Why not just <em>keep that probability</em> as the experimental prediction?&#xA0; Why <em>further</em> specify that this is the <em>probability of</em> original-ness?&#xA0; Adding that last rule doesn't help you compute any <em>better</em> experimental predictions; and it leaves all the original mysteries intact.&#xA0; Including Po'mi's question as to when exactly a world splits.&#xA0; And it adds the new mystery of why original-ness should only end up in one world-side, with probability equal to the square of the thickness."&#xA0; &#xA0;Yu'el pauses.&#xA0; "You might as
well just claim that all the split world-sides except one vanish from the
universe."

</p>
<p>Bo'ma snorts.&#xA0; "For a
world-side to 'just vanish' would outright violate the laws of physics. 
Why, if it all vanished in an instant, that would mean the event occurred
non-locally - faster than light.&#xA0; My suggestion about 'originals' and
'copies' doesn't postulate unphysical behavior, whatever other criticisms you
may have."

</p>
<p>Yu'el nods.&#xA0; "You're right,
that was unfair of me.&#xA0; I apologize."

</p>
<p>"Well," says Bo'ma, "how about this, then?&#xA0; What if 'fourth-dimensional thickness', as we've been calling it, is actually a <em>degree of partial information</em> about who we <em>really</em> are?&#xA0; And then when the world splits, we find out."</p>
<p>"Um... <em>what</em>?" says Yu'el.&#xA0; "Are you sure you don't want to rephrase that, or something?"</p>
<p>Bo'ma shakes his head.&#xA0; "No, you heard me the first time."</p>
<p>"Okay," says Yu'el, "correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought I heard Nharglane say that you had to do things like differentiate the fourth-dimensional density in order to do your experimental calculations.&#xA0; That doesn't sound like probability theory to me.&#xA0; It sounds like physics."</p>
<p>"Right," Bo'ma says, "it's a quantity that propagates around with wave mechanics that involve the differential of the density, but it's <em>also</em> a degree of partial information."</p>
<p>"Look," Yu'el says, "if this 4D density business works the way you say it does, it should be easy to set up a situation where there's no <em>possible</em> 'fact as to who you really are' that is fixed in advance but unknown to you, because the so-called 'answer' will change depending on the so-called 'question' - "</p>
<p>"Okay," Bo'ma says, "forget the 'probability' part.&#xA0; What if 4D thickness is <em>the very stuff of reality itself?</em>&#xA0; So how <em>real</em> something is, equals the 4D thickness - no, pardon me, the square of the 4D thickness.&#xA0; Thus, some world-sides are quantitatively <em>realer</em> than others, and that's why you're more likely to find yourself in them."</p>
<p>"Why," says Yu'el, "is the <em>very stuff of reality itself</em> manifesting as a physical quantity with its own wave mechanics?&#xA0; What's next, electrical charge as a degree of possibility?&#xA0; And besides, doesn't that violate -"</p>
<p>Then Yu'el pauses, and falls silent.</p>
<p>"What is it?" inquires Po'mi.</p>
<p>"I was about to say, wouldn't that violate the <a href="/lw/p9/the_generalized_antizombie_principle/">Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle</a>," Yu'el replies slowly.&#xA0; "Because then you could have a complete mathematical model of our world, to be looked over by the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and then <em>afterward </em>you would need to tell the Flying Spaghetti Monster an <em>extra</em> postulate:&#xA0; <em>Things are real in proportion to the square of their fourth-dimensional thickness.</em>&#xA0; You could change that postulate, and leave everything microphysically the same, but people would find... different proportions of themselves?... in different places.&#xA0; The difference would be detectable <em>internally</em>... sort of... because the inhabitants would <em>experience</em> the results in different proportions, whatever that means.&#xA0; They would see different things, or at least see the same things in different relative amounts.&#xA0; But any third-party observer, looking over the universe, couldn't tell which internal people were <em>more real,</em> and so couldn't discover the statistics of experience."</p>
<p>De'da laughs.&#xA0; "Sounds like a crushing objection to me."</p>
<p>"Only," says Yu'el, "is that really so different from believing that you can have the whole mathematical structure of a world, and then an <em>extra</em> fact as to whether that world happens to <em>exist</em> or <em>not exist</em>?&#xA0; Shouldn't <em>that</em> be ruled out by the Anti-Zombie Principle too?&#xA0; Shouldn't the Anti-Zombie Principle say that it was logically impossible to have had a world physically identical to our own, except that it <em>doesn't exist?</em>&#xA0; &#xA0;Otherwise there could be an abstract mathematical object structurally identical to this world, but with <em>no experiences in it</em>, because<em> it doesn't exist</em>.&#xA0; And papers that philosophers wrote about subjectivity wouldn't prove they were conscious, because the papers would also 'not exist'."</p>
<p>"Um..." says an Ebborian in the crowd, "correct me if I'm mistaken, but didn't you just solve the mystery of the First Cause?"</p>
<p>"You are mistaken," replies Yu'el.&#xA0; "I can tell when I have <em>solved</em> a mystery, because it stops being mysterious.&#xA0; To cleverly manipulate my own confusion is not to dissolve a problem.&#xA0; It is an interesting argument, and I may try to follow it further - but it's not an <em>answer</em> until the confusion goes away."</p>
<p>"Nonetheless," says Bo'ma, "if you're allowed to say that some worlds exist, and some worlds don't, why not have a degree of existence that's <em>quantitative?</em>&#xA0; And propagates around like a wave, and then we have to square it to get an answer."</p>
<p>Yu'el snorts.&#xA0; "Why not just let the 'degree of existence' be a complex number, while you're at it?"</p>
<p>Bo'ma rolls his eyes.&#xA0; "Please stop mocking me.&#xA0; I can't even <em>imagine </em>any possible experimental evidence which would point in the direction of <em>that</em> conclusion.&#xA0; You'd need a case where two events that were real in opposite directions canceled each other out."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," says Yu'el, "I need to learn to control my tendency to attack straw opponents.&#xA0; But still, where would the squaring rule come from?"</p>
<p>An Ebborian named Ev'Hu suggests, "Well, you could have a rule that world-sides whose thickness tends toward zero, must have a degree of reality that also tends to zero.&#xA0; And then the rule which says that you square the thickness of a world-side, would let the probability tend toward zero as the world-thickness tended toward zero.&#xA0; QED."</p>
<p dragover="true">"That's not QED," says Po'mi.&#xA0; "That's a complete non-sequitur.&#xA0; Logical fallacy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent">affirming the consequent</a>.&#xA0; You could have all <em>sorts</em> of rules that would let the reality tend toward zero as the world-thickness tended toward zero, not just the squaring rule.&#xA0; You could approach the limit from many different directions.&#xA0; And in fact, <em>all </em>our world-sides have a thickness that 'tends toward zero' because they keep splitting.&#xA0; Furthermore, why would an indefinite tendency in the infinite future have any impact on what we do now?"</p>
<p>"The frequentist heresy," says Yu'el. "It sounds like some of their scriptures.&#xA0; But let's move on.&#xA0; Does anyone have any <em>helpful</em> suggestions?&#xA0; Ones that don't just shuffle the mystery around?"</p>
<p>Ha'ro speaks.&#xA0; "I've got one."</p>
<p>"Okay," Yu'el says, "this should be good."</p>
<p>"Suppose that when a world-side gets thin enough," Ha'ro says, "<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/mangledworlds.html">it cracks to pieces and falls apart</a>.&#xA0; And then, when you did the statistics, it would turn out that the vast majority of <em>surviving</em> worlds have splitting histories similar to our own."</p>
<p>There's a certain unsettled pause.</p>
<p>"Ha'ro," says Nharglane of Ebbore, "to the best of my imperfect recollection, that is the most disturbing suggestion any Ebborian physicist has ever made in the history of time."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," says Ha'ro.&#xA0; "But it could also be that a too-small world-side just sheds off in flakes when it splits, rather than containing actual sentient beings who get to experience a moment of horrified doom.&#xA0; The too-small worlds merely fail to exist, as it were.&#xA0; Or maybe sufficiently small world-sides get attracted to larger world-sides, and merge with them in a continuous process, obliterating the memories of anything having happened differently.&#xA0; But <em>that's</em> not important, the <em>real</em> question is whether the numbers would work out for the right size limit, and in fact," Ha'ro waves some <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/worldhit.pdf">calculations</a> on a piece of paper, "all you need is for the minimum size of a cohesive world to be somewhere around the point where half the total fourth-dimensional mass is above the limit -"</p>
<p>"Eh?" says Yu'el.</p>
<p>"I figured some numbers and they don't look too implausible and we might be able to prove it, either from first-principles of 4D physics showing that a cracking process occurs, or with some kind of <em>really clever</em> experiment," amplifies Ha'ro.</p>
<p>"Sounds promising," says Yu'el.&#xA0; "So if I get what you're saying, there would be a <em>completely physical</em> explanation for why, when a typical bunch of worlds split 2:1, there's around 4 times as many cohesive worlds left that split from the thicker side, as from the thinner side."</p>
<p>"Yes," says Ha'ro, "you just count the surviving worlds."</p>
<p>"And if the Flying Spaghetti Monster ran a simulation of our universe's physics, the simulation would automatically include observers that experienced the same things we did, with the same statistical probabilities," says Yu'el.&#xA0; "No extra postulates required.&#xA0; None of the quantities in the universe would need additional characteristics beyond their strictly physical structure.&#xA0; Running any mathematically equivalent computer program would do the trick - you wouldn't need to be told how to <em>interpret</em> it a particular way."</p>
<p>Ha'ro nods.&#xA0; "That's the general idea."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know if that's <em>correct,</em>" says Yu'el.&#xA0; "There's some potential issues, as you know.&#xA0; But I've got to say it's the first suggestion I've heard that's even <em>remotely</em> helpful in making all this seem any less mysterious."</p></div></div></div>
