<p><a href="/lw/pv/the_conscious_sorites_paradox/">Yesterday's post</a>
argued that continuity of decoherence is no bar to accepting it as an
explanation for our experienced universe, insofar as it is a
physicist's responsibility to explain it.&#xA0; This is a good thing,
because the equations say decoherence is continuous, and the equations get the final word.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the continuity of decoherence in greater detail...

</p>
<a id="more"></a><p><a href="/lw/pv/the_conscious_sorites_paradox/">&#xA0;</a><a href="/lw/pu/on_being_decoherent/">On Being Decoherent</a> talked about the decoherence process,</p><blockquote><p>(Human-BLANK) * (Sensor-BLANK) * (Atom-LEFT + Atom-RIGHT)<br>&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; =&gt;<br>(Human-BLANK) * ((Sensor-LEFT * Atom-LEFT) + (Sensor-RIGHT * Atom-RIGHT))<br>&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; =&gt;<br>(Human-LEFT * Sensor-LEFT * Atom-LEFT) + (Human-RIGHT * Sensor-RIGHT * Atom-RIGHT)</p></blockquote><p>At the end of this process, it may be that your brain in LEFT and your brain in RIGHT are, in a technical sense, communicating
- that they have intersecting, interfering amplitude flows.</p>
<p>But
the amplitude involved in this process, is the amplitude for a brain
(plus all entangled particles) to leap into the other brain's state. 
This influence may, in a quantitative sense, exist; but it's
exponentially tinier than the gravitational influence upon your brain
of a mouse sneezing on Pluto.</p>
<p>By the same token, decoherence <em>always</em> entangles you with a
blob of amplitude density, not a point mass of amplitude.&#xA0; A
point mass of amplitude would be a discontinuous amplitude
distribution, hence unphysical.&#xA0; The distribution can be very narrow,
very sharp - even exponentially narrow - but it can't actually be pointed (nondifferentiable), let alone a point mass.</p>
<p>Decoherence, you might say, is pointless.</p>
<p>If a measuring
instrument is sensitive enough to distinguish 10 positions with 10 separate displays on a little LCD screen, it will decohere the amplitude into at least 10 parts, almost entirely noninteracting.&#xA0; In all probability, the instrument is <em>physically</em>
quite a bit more sensitive (in terms of evolving
into different configurations) than what it shows on screen.&#xA0; You would
find experimentally that the particle was being decohered (with
consequences for momentum, etc.) more than the instrument was designed
to measure from a human standpoint.</p>
<p>But there
is no such thing as infinite sensitivity in a continuous quantum physics:&#xA0; If
you start with blobs of amplitude density, you don't end up with point
masses.&#xA0; <a href="/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/">Liouville's Theorem</a>, which generalizes the <a href="/lw/o5/the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_and_engines_of/">second law of thermodynamics</a>, guarantees this: you can't compress probability.</p>
<p>What about if you measure the position of an Atom using an analog Sensor whose dial shows a continuous reading?</p>
<p>Think of probability theory over classical physics:</p>
<p>When the Sensor's dial appears in a particular position, that gives us evidence corresponding to the <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html">likelihood function</a>
for the Sensor's dial to be in that place, given that the Atom was
originally in a particular position.&#xA0; If the instrument is not
infinitely sensitive (which it can't be, for numerous reasons), then
the likelihood function will be a density distribution, not a point
mass.&#xA0; A very sensitive Sensor might have a sharp spike of a likelihood
distribution, with density falling off rapidly.&#xA0; If the Atom is <em>really </em>at
position 5.0121, the likelihood of the Sensor's dial ending up in
position 5.0123 might be very small.&#xA0; And so, unless we had
overwhelming prior knowledge, we'd conclude a tiny posterior
probability that the Atom was so much as 0.0002 millimeters from the
Sensor's indicated position.&#xA0; That's probability theory over classical
physics.</p>
<p>Similarly in quantum physics:</p>
<p dragover="true">The blob of amplitude in which you find yourself,
where you see the Sensor's dial in some particular position, will have
a sub-distribution over actual Atom positions that falls off according
to (1) the initial amplitude distribution for the Atom, analogous to
the prior; and (2) the amplitude for the Sensor's dial (and the rest of
the Sensor!) to end up in our part of configuration space, <em>if</em>
the Atom started out in that position.&#xA0; (That's the part analogous to
the likelihood function.)&#xA0; With a Sensor at all sensitive, the
amplitude for the Atom to be in a state noticeably different from what
the Sensor shows, will taper off very sharply.</p>
<p dragover="true">(All
these amplitudes I'm talking about are actually densities,
N-dimensional integrals over dx dy dz..., rather than discrete flows
between discrete states; but you get the idea.)</p>
<p dragover="true">If there's not a lot of amplitude flowing from initial
particle position 5.0150 +/- 0.0001 to configurations where the
sensor's LED display reads '5.0123', then the <em>joint</em> configuration of (Sensor=5.0123 * Atom=5.0150) ends up with very tiny amplitude.</p></div></div></div>
