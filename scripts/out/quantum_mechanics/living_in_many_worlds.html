<p>Some commenters have recently expressed disturbance at the thought of constantly splitting into zillions of other people, as is the <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/many-worlds-one.html">straightforward and unavoidable prediction of quantum mechanics</a>.</p>
<p>Others have confessed themselves unclear as to the implications of many-worlds for planning:&#xA0; If you decide to buckle your seat belt in this world, does that increase the chance of another self unbuckling their seat belt?&#xA0; Are you being selfish at their expense?</p>
<p>Just remember Egan's Law:&#xA0; <em>It all adds up to normality.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.robertboynton.com/?art_id=119">Frank Sulloway</a> said:&#xA0; "Ironically, psychoanalysis has it over Darwinism precisely because its predictions are so outlandish and its explanations are so counterintuitive that we think, <em>Is that really true? How radical!</em> Freud&#x2019;s ideas are so intriguing that people are willing to pay for them, while one of the great disadvantages of Darwinism is that we feel we know it already, because, in a sense, we do."</p>
<p>When Einstein overthrew the Newtonian version of gravity, apples didn't stop falling, planets didn't swerve into the Sun.&#xA0; Every new theory of physics must <em>capture</em> the successful predictions of the old theory it displaced; it should predict that the sky will be blue, rather than green.</p>
<p>So don't think that many-worlds is there to make strange, radical, exciting predictions.&#xA0; It all adds up to normality.</p>
<p>Then why should anyone care?</p>
<p>Because there was once asked the question, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/joy-in-the-real.html">fascinating</a> unto a rationalist:&#xA0; <em>What</em> all adds up to normality?</p>
<p>And the answer to this question turns out to be: quantum mechanics.&#xA0; It is <em>quantum mechanics</em> that adds up to normality.</p>
<p>If there were something else there <em>instead</em> of quantum mechanics, <em>then</em> the world would look strange and unusual.</p>
<p>Bear this in mind, when you are wondering how to live in the strange new universe of many worlds:&#xA0; <em>You have always been there.</em></p>
<p>Religions, anthropologists tell us, usually exhibit a property called <em>minimal counterintuitiveness;</em> they are startling enough to be memorable, but not so bizarre as to be <em>difficult</em> to memorize.&#xA0; Anubis has the head of a dog, which makes him memorable, but the rest of him is the body of a man.&#xA0; Spirits can see through walls; <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=1038">but they still become hungry</a>.</p>
<p>But physics is not a religion, set to surprise you just exactly enough to be memorable.&#xA0; The underlying phenomena are so counterintuitive that it takes long study for humans to come to grips with them.&#xA0; But the surface phenomena are entirely ordinary.&#xA0; You will <em>never</em> catch a glimpse of another world out of the corner of your eye.&#xA0; You will <em>never</em> hear the voice of some other self.&#xA0; That is unambiguously prohibited outright by the laws.&#xA0; Sorry, you're just schizophrenic.</p>
<p>The act of making <em>decisions</em> has no special interaction with the process that branches worlds.&#xA0; In your <em>mind,</em> in your <em>imagination,</em> a decision seems like a branching point where the world could go two different ways.&#xA0; But you would feel just the same uncertainty, visualize just the same alternatives, if there were only one world.&#xA0; That's what people thought for centuries before quantum mechanics, and they still visualized alternative outcomes that could result from their decisions.</p>
<p><em>Decision </em>and <em>decoherence</em> are <em>entirely orthogonal concepts.</em>&#xA0; If your brain never became decoherent, then that single cognitive process would still have to imagine different choices and their different outcomes.&#xA0; And a rock, which makes no decisions, obeys the same laws of quantum mechanics as anything else, and splits frantically as it lies in one place.</p>
<p>You don't split <em>when you come to a decision</em> in <em>particular,</em> any more than you particularly split when you take a breath.&#xA0; You're just splitting all the time as the result of decoherence, which has nothing to do with choices.</p>
<p>There is a population of worlds, and in each world, it all adds up to normality: apples don't stop falling.&#xA0; In each world, people choose the course that seems best to them.&#xA0; Maybe they happen on a different line of thinking, and see new implications or miss others, and come to a different choice.&#xA0; But it's not that one world chooses each choice.&#xA0; It's not that one version of you chooses what seems best, and another version chooses what seems worst.&#xA0; In each world, apples go on falling and people go on doing what seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>Yes, you can nitpick exceptions to this rule, but they're <em>normal</em> exceptions.&#xA0; It all adds up to normality, in all the worlds.</p>
<p>You cannot "choose which world to end up in".&#xA0; In all the worlds, people's choices determine outcomes in the same way they would in just one single world.</p>
<p>The choice you make here does not have some strange balancing influence on some world elsewhere.&#xA0; There is no causal communication between decoherent worlds.&#xA0; In each world, people's choices control the future of that world, not some other world.</p>
<p>If you can imagine decisionmaking in one world, you can imagine decision-making in many worlds: just have the world constantly splitting while otherwise obeying all the same rules.</p>
<p>In no world does two plus two equal five.&#xA0; In no world can spaceships travel faster than light.&#xA0; All the quantum worlds obey our laws of physics; their existence is asserted in the first place by our laws of physics.&#xA0; Since the beginning, not one unusual thing has ever happened, in this or any other world.&#xA0; They are all lawful.</p>
<p>Are there horrible worlds out there, which are utterly beyond your ability to affect?&#xA0; Sure.&#xA0; And horrible things happened during the 12th century, which are also beyond your ability to affect.&#xA0; But the 12th century is not your responsibility, because it has, as the quaint phrase goes, "already happened".&#xA0; I would suggest that you consider every world which is not in your future, to be part of the "generalized past".</p>
<p>Live in your own world.&#xA0; Before you knew about quantum physics, you would not have been tempted to try living in a world that did not seem to exist.&#xA0; Your decisions should add up to this same normality: you shouldn't try to live in a quantum world you can't communicate with.</p>
<p>Your decision theory should (almost always) be the same, whether you suppose that there is a 90% probability of something happening, or if it will happen in 9 out of 10 worlds.&#xA0; Now, because people have trouble handling probabilities, it may be helpful to visualize something happening in 9 out of 10 worlds.&#xA0; But this just helps you use normal decision theory.</p>
<p>If you've been putting it off before, now is the time to learn to <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/the-intuitions.html">shut up and multiply</a>.&#xA0; As I noted in <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/04/lotteries_a_was.html">Lotteries: A Waste of Hope</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The human brain doesn't do 64-bit floating-point arithmetic, and it can't devalue the emotional force of a pleasant anticipation by a factor of 0.00000001 without dropping the line of reasoning entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/04/new_improved_lo.html">New Improved Lottery</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between zero chance of becoming wealthy, and epsilon chance, there is an order-of-epsilon difference.&#xA0; If you doubt this, let epsilon equal one over googolplex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're thinking about a world that could arise in a lawful way, but whose probability is a quadrillion to one, and something very pleasant or very awful is happening in this world... well, it does probably exist, if it is lawful.&#xA0; But you should try to release one quadrillionth as many neurotransmitters, in your reward centers or your aversive centers, so that you can weigh that world <em>appropriately</em> in your decisions.&#xA0; If you don't think you can do that... don't bother thinking about it.</p>
<p>Otherwise you might as well go out and buy a lottery ticket using a quantum random number, a strategy that is <em>guaranteed</em> to result in a very tiny mega-win.</p>
<p>Or here's another way of thinking about it:&#xA0; Are you considering expending some mental energy on a world whose frequency in your future is less than a trillionth?&#xA0; Then go get a 10-sided die from your local gaming store, and, before you begin thinking about that strange world, start rolling the die.&#xA0; If the die comes up 9 twelve times in a row, <em>then </em>you can think about that world.&#xA0; Otherwise don't waste your time; thought-time is a resource to be expended wisely.</p>
<p>You can roll the dice as many times as you like, but you can't think about the world until 9 comes up twelve times in a row.&#xA0; Then you can think about it for a minute.&#xA0; After that you have to start rolling the die again.</p>
<p>This may help you to appreciate the concept of "trillion to one" on a more visceral level.</p>
<p>If at any point you catch yourself thinking that quantum physics might have some kind of strange, <em>abnormal</em> implication for everyday life - then you should probably stop right there.</p>
<p>Oh, there are a <em>few</em> implications of many-worlds for ethics. Average utilitarianism suddenly looks a lot more attractive - you don't need to worry about creating as many people as possible, because there are already plenty of people exploring person-space.&#xA0; You just want the average quality of life to be as high as possible, in the future worlds that are your responsibility.</p>
<p>And you should always take <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/joy-in-discover.html">joy in discovery</a>, as long as <em>you personally</em> don't know a thing.&#xA0; It is meaningless to talk of being the "first" or the "only" person to know a thing, when everything knowable is known within worlds that are in neither your past nor your future, and are neither before or after you.</p>
<p>But, by and large, it all adds up to normality.&#xA0; If your understanding of many-worlds is the tiniest bit <em>shaky</em>, and you are contemplating whether to believe some strange proposition, or feel some strange emotion, or plan some strange strategy, then I can give you very simple advice:&#xA0; Don't.</p>
<p>The quantum universe is not a strange place into which you have been thrust.&#xA0; It is the way things have always been.</p></div></div></div>
