<p>"In light of your QM explanation, which to me sounds perfectly logical, it seems <em>obvious and normal</em> that many worlds is overwhelmingly likely. It just seems almost too good to be true that <em>I</em>
now get what plenty of genius quantum physicists still can't. [...]
Sure I can explain all that away, and I still think you're right, I'm
just suspicious of myself for believing the first believable
explanation I met."<br>&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; -- <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/many-worlds-one.html#comment-114204220">Recovering irrationalist</a></p></blockquote><p>RI, you've got no idea how glad I was to see you post that comment.</p>
<p>Of course I had more than just <em>one</em> reason for spending all
that time posting about quantum physics.&#xA0; I like having lots of hidden
motives, it's the closest I can ethically get to being a supervillain.</p>
<p>But to give an example of a purpose I could <em>only</em> accomplish by discussing quantum physics...</p>
<p>In physics, you can get absolutely clear-cut issues.&#xA0; Not in the
sense that the issues are trivial to explain.&#xA0; But if you try to apply
Bayes to healthcare, or economics, you may not be able to <em>formally</em>
lay out what is the simplest hypothesis, or what the evidence
supports.&#xA0; But when I say "macroscopic decoherence is simpler than
collapse" it is actually <em>strict</em> simplicity; you could write the
two hypotheses out as computer programs and count the lines of code. 
Nor is the evidence itself in dispute.</p>
<p>I wanted a very clear example - <em>Bayes says "zig", this is a zag</em> - when it came time to break your allegiance to Science.</p><a id="more"></a><p>"Oh, sure," you say, "the physicists messed up the many-worlds
thing, but give them a break, Eliezer!&#xA0; No one ever claimed that the
social process of science was perfect.&#xA0; People are human; they make
mistakes."</p>
<p>But the physicists who refuse to adopt many-worlds aren't disobeying the rules of Science.&#xA0; They're <em>obeying</em> the rules of Science.</p>
<p>The tradition handed down through the generations says that a new
physics theory comes up with new experimental predictions that
distinguish it from the old theory.&#xA0; You perform the test, and the new
theory is confirmed or falsified.&#xA0; If it's confirmed, you hold a huge
celebration, call the newspapers, and hand out Nobel Prizes for
everyone; any doddering old emeritus professors who refuse to convert
are quietly humored.&#xA0; If the theory is disconfirmed, the lead proponent
publicly recants, and gains a reputation for honesty.</p>
<p>This is not how
things <em>do </em>work in science; rather it is how things are <em>supposed</em> to work in Science.&#xA0; It's the ideal to which all good scientists aspire.</p>
<p>Now many-worlds comes along, and it doesn't seem to make any new
predictions relative to the old theory.&#xA0; That's suspicious.&#xA0; And
there's all these other worlds, but you can't see them.&#xA0; That's <em>really </em>suspicious.&#xA0; It just doesn't seem scientific.</p>
<p>If you got as far as RI - so that many-worlds now seems perfectly logical, obvious and normal - <em>and</em>
you also started out as a Traditional Rationalist, then you should be
able to switch back and forth between the Scientific view and the
Bayesian view, like a Necker Cube.</p>
<p>So now put on your Science Goggles - you've still got them around
somewhere, right?&#xA0; Forget everything you know about Kolmogorov
complexity, Solomonoff induction or Minimum Message Lengths.&#xA0; That's
not part of the traditional training.&#xA0; You just eyeball something to
see how "simple" it looks.&#xA0; The word "testable" doesn't conjure up a
mental image of Bayes's Theorem governing probability flows; it
conjures up a mental image of being in a lab, performing an experiment,
and having the celebration (or public recantation) afterward.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Science-Goggles on</em>:&#xA0; The current quantum theory
has passed all experimental tests so far.&#xA0; Many-Worlds doesn't make any
new testable predictions - the amazing new phenomena it predicts are
all hidden away where we can't see them.&#xA0; You can get along fine
without supposing the other worlds, and that's just what you should
do.&#xA0; The whole thing smacks of science fiction.&#xA0; But it must be
admitted that quantum physics is a very deep and very confusing issue,
and who knows what discoveries might be in store?&#xA0; Call me when
Many-Worlds makes a testable prediction.</p></blockquote><p>Science-Goggles off, Bayes-Goggles back on:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Bayes-Goggles on</em>:&#xA0; The simplest quantum equations
that cover all known evidence don't have a special exception for
human-sized masses.&#xA0; There isn't even any reason to ask that particular
question.&#xA0; Next!</p></blockquote><p>Okay, so is this a problem we can fix in five minutes with some duct tape and superglue?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Huh?&#xA0; Why not just teach new graduating classes of scientists about Solomonoff induction and Bayes's Rule?</p>
<p>Centuries ago, there was a widespread idea that the Wise could
unravel the secrets of the universe just by thinking about them, while
to go out and <em>look</em> at things was lesser, inferior, naive, and would just delude you in the end.&#xA0; You couldn't trust the way things <em>looked</em> - only thought could be your guide.</p>
<p>Science began as a rebellion against this Deep Wisdom.&#xA0; At the core
is the pragmatic belief that human beings, sitting around in their
armchairs trying to be Deeply Wise, just drift off into never-never
land.&#xA0; You couldn't trust your thoughts.&#xA0; You had to make advance
experimental predictions - predictions that no one else had made before
- run the test, and confirm the result.&#xA0; That was evidence.&#xA0; Sitting in
your armchair, thinking about what seemed reasonable... would not be
taken to <em>prejudice</em> your theory, because Science wasn't an
idealistic belief about pragmatism, or getting your hands dirty.&#xA0; It
was, rather, the dictum that experiment alone would decide.&#xA0; Only
experiments could judge your theory - not your nationality, or your
religious professions, or the fact that you'd invented the theory in
your armchair.&#xA0; Only experiments!&#xA0; If you sat in your
armchair and came up with a theory that made a novel prediction, and
experiment confirmed the prediction, then we would care about the
result of the experiment, not where your hypothesis came from.</p>
<p><em>That's</em> Science.&#xA0; And if you say that Many-Worlds should
replace the immensely successful Copenhagen Interpretation, adding on
all these twin Earths that can't be observed, just because it <em>sounds more reasonable and elegant</em> - not because it <em>crushed the old theory with a superior experimental prediction</em>
- then you're undoing the core scientific rule that prevents people
from running out and putting angels into all the theories, because
angels are more reasonable and elegant.</p>
<p>You think teaching a few people about Solomonoff induction is going to solve <em>that</em> problem?&#xA0; Nobel laureate Robert Aumann - who first proved that Bayesian agents with similar priors cannot agree to disagree - is a believing Orthodox Jew.&#xA0; Aumann helped a project to test the Torah for "Bible codes", hidden prophecies from God - and concluded that the project had failed to confirm the codes' existence.&#xA0; Do you want Aumann thinking that once you've got Solomonoff induction, you can forget about the experimental method?&#xA0; Do you think that's going to help him?&#xA0; And most scientists out there will not rise to the level of Robert Aumann.</p>
<p>Okay, Bayes-Goggles back on.&#xA0; Are you <em>really</em> going to believe
that large parts of the wavefunction disappear when you can no longer
see them?&#xA0; As a result of the only non-linear non-unitary
non-differentiable non-CPT-symmetric acausal faster-than-light
informally-specified phenomenon in all of physics?&#xA0; Just because, by
sheer historical contingency, the stupid version of the theory was
proposed first?</p>
<p>Are you going to make a major modification to a scientific model,
and believe in zillions of other worlds you can't see, without a
defining moment of experimental triumph over the old
model?</p>
<p>Or are you going to reject probability theory?</p>
<p dragover="true">Will you give your allegiance to Science, or to Bayes?</p>
<p dragover="true">Michael Vassar once observed (tongue-in-cheek) that
it was a good thing that a majority of the human species believed in
God, because otherwise, he would have a very hard time rejecting <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/03/on_majoritarian.html">majoritarianism</a>. 
But since the majority opinion that God exists is simply unbelievable,
we have no choice but to reject the extremely strong philosophical
arguments for majoritarianism.</p>
<p dragover="true">
You can see (one of the reasons) why I went to such lengths to explain
quantum theory.&#xA0; Those who are good at math should now be able to <em>visualize</em> both <a href="/lw/pu/on_being_decoherent/">macroscopic decoherence</a>, and the probability theory of <a href="/lw/q3/decoherence_is_simple/">simplicity and testability</a> - get the insanity of a global single world on a <em>gut</em> level.</p>
<p dragover="true">I wanted to present you with a nice, sharp dilemma between rejecting the scientific method, or embracing insanity.</p>
<p dragover="true">Why?&#xA0; I'll give you a hint:&#xA0; It's not just because I'm evil.&#xA0; If you would guess my motives here, think beyond the first obvious answer.</p>
<p dragover="true">PS:&#xA0; If you try to come up with clever ways to
wriggle out of the dilemma, you're just going to get shot down in
future posts.&#xA0; You have been warned.</p></div></div></div>
