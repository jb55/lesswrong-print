</em><strong>Previously in series</strong>:&#xA0; <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/relative-config.html">Relative Configuration Space</a><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/dissolving-the.html">&#xA0;</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Warning:&#xA0; The central idea in today's post is taken seriously by serious physicists; but it is not experimentally proven and is not taught as standard physics.</strong></p>
<p>Today's post draws heavily on the work of the physicist <a href="http://www.platonia.com/papers.html">Julian Barbour</a>, and contains diagrams stolen and/or modified from his book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0753810204/platonia">The End of Time</a>".&#xA0; However, some of the arguments here are of my own devising, and Barbour might(?) not agree with them.</p></blockquote><p>I shall begin by asking a incredibly deep question:</p>
<p>What time is it?</p>
<p>If you have the <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/truth.html">excellent habit</a> of giving obvious answers to obvious questions, you will answer, "It is now 7:30pm [or whatever]."</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>"I know because I looked at the clock on my computer monitor."</p>
<p>Well, suppose I hacked into your computer and changed the clock.&#xA0; Would it then be a different time?</p>
<p>"No," you reply.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>"Because I once used the 'Set Date and Time' facility on my computer to try and make it be the 22nd century, but it didn't work."</p>
<p>Ah.&#xA0; And how do you <em>know</em> that it <em>didn't</em> work?</p><a id="more"></a><p>"Because," you say, "I looked outside, and the buildings were still made of brick and wood and steel, rather than having been replaced by the gleaming crystal of diamondoid nanotechnological constructions; and gasoline was still only $4/gallon."</p>
<p>You have... <em>interesting</em>... expectations for the <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/stranger-than-h.html">22nd century</a>; but let's not go into that.&#xA0; Suppose I replaced the buildings outside your home with confections of crystal, and raised the price of gas; <em>then</em> would it be 100 years later?</p>
<p>"No," you say, "I could look up at the night sky, and see the planets in roughly the same position as yesterday's night; with a powerful telescope I could measure the positions of the stars as they very slowly drift, relative to the Sun, and observe the rotation of distant galaxies.&#xA0; In these ways I would know exactly how much time had passed, no matter what you did here on Earth."</p>
<p>Ah.&#xA0; And suppose I snapped my fingers and caused all the stars and galaxies to move into the appropriate positions for 2108?</p>
<p>"You'd be arrested for violating the laws of physics."</p>
<p>But suppose I did it anyway.</p>
<p>"Then, still, 100 years would not have passed."</p>
<p>How would you <em>know</em> they had not passed?</p>
<p>"Because I would remember that, one night before, it had still been 2008.&#xA0; Though, realistically speaking, I would think it more likely that it was my memory at fault, not the galaxies."</p>
<p>Now suppose I snapped my fingers, and caused <em>all</em> the atoms in the universe to move into positions that would be appropriate for (one probable quantum branch) of 2108.&#xA0; Even the atoms in your brain.</p>
<p>Think carefully before you say, "It would still <em>really</em> be 2008."&#xA0; For does this belief of yours, have <em>any</em> <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/making-beliefs-.html">observable consequences</a> left?&#xA0; Or is it an <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/relative-config.html">epiphenomenon of your model of physics</a>?&#xA0; <em>Where</em> is stored the fact that it is 'still 2008'?&#xA0; Can I snap my fingers one last time, and alter this last variable, and cause it to <em>really </em>be 2108?</p>
<p>Is it possible that Cthulhu could snap Its tentacles, and cause time <em>for the whole universe</em> to be suspended for exactly 10 million years, and then resume?&#xA0; How would anyone ever detect what had just happened?</p>
<p>A global suspension of time may seem <em>imaginable</em>, in the same way that it seems imaginable that you could "<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/machs-principle.html">move all the matter in the whole universe ten meters to the left</a>".&#xA0; To visualize the universe moving ten meters to the left, you imagine a little swirling ball of galaxies, and then it jerks leftward.&#xA0; Similarly, to imagine time stopping, you visualize a swirling ball of galaxies, and then it stops swirling, and hangs motionless for a while, and then starts up again.</p>
<p>But the sensation of passing time, in your visualization, is provided by your own mind's eye outside the system.&#xA0; <em>You </em>go on thinking, your brain's neurons firing, while, in your <em>imagination</em>, the swirling ball of galaxies stays motionless.</p>
<p>When you <em>imagine</em> the universe moving ten meters to the left, you are imagining motion <em>relative </em>to your mind's eye outside the universe.&#xA0; In the same way, when you imagine time stopping, you are <em>imagining</em> a motionless universe, frozen <em>relative</em> to a still-moving clock hidden outside: your own mind, counting the seconds of the freeze.</p>
<p>But what would it mean for 10 million "years" to pass, if motion <em>everywhere</em> had been suspended?</p>
<p>Does it make sense to say that the global rate of motion could slow down, or speed up, over the whole universe at once - so that all the particles arrive at the same final configuration, in twice as much time, or half as much time?&#xA0; You couldn't measure it with any clock, because the ticking of the clock would slow down too.</p>
<p>Do not say, "I could not detect it; therefore, who knows, it might happen every day."</p>
<p>Say rather, "I could not detect it, nor could anyone detect it even in principle, nor would any physical relation be affected <em>except</em> this one thing called 'the global rate of motion'.&#xA0; Therefore, I wonder what the phrase 'global rate of motion' really <em>means</em>."</p>
<p>All of that was a line of argument of Julian Barbour's, more or less,&#xA0; Let us pause here, and consider a second line of argument, this one my own.&#xA0; That is, I don't think it was in Barbour's <em>The End of Time.</em>&#xA0; (If I recall correctly, I reasoned thus even before I read Barbour, while I was coming up with my <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/newcombs-proble.html">unpublished general decision theory of Newcomblike problems</a>.&#xA0; Of course that does not mean the argument is novel; I have no idea whether it is novel.&#xA0; But if my argument is wrong, I do not want it blamed on an innocent bystander.)&#xA0; So:</p><blockquote><p>"The future changes as we stand here, else we
are the game pieces of the gods, not their heirs, as we have been
promised."<br>&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; -- Raistlin Majere</p></blockquote>
<p>A fine sentiment; but what does it mean to <em>change</em> the future?</p>
<p>Suppose I have a lamp, with an old-style compact fluorescent bulb that takes a few seconds to warm up.&#xA0; At 7:00am, the lamp is off.&#xA0; At 7:01am, I flip the switch; the lamp flickers for a few moments, then begins to warm up.&#xA0; At 7:02am, the lamp is fully bright.&#xA0; Between 7:00am and 7:02am, the lamp changed from OFF to ON.&#xA0; This, certainly, is a change; but it is a change <em>over time.</em></p>
<p>Change implies difference; difference implies comparison.&#xA0; Here, the two values being compared are (1) the state of "the lamp at 7:00am", which is OFF, and (2) the state of "the lamp at 7:02am", which is ON.&#xA0; So we say "the lamp" has <em>changed</em> from one time to another.&#xA0; At 7:00am, you wander by, and see the lamp is OFF; at 7:02am, you wander by, and see the lamp is ON.</p>
<p>But have you ever seen the <em>future</em> change from one time to another?&#xA0; Have you wandered by a lamp at exactly 7:02am, and seen that it is OFF; then, a bit later, looked in again on the "the lamp at exactly 7:02am", and discovered that it is now ON?</p>
<p>Naturally, we often <em>feel</em> like we are "changing the future".&#xA0; Logging on to your online bank account, you discover that your credit card bill comes due tomorrow, and, for some reason, has not been paid automatically.&#xA0; <em>Imagining</em> the future-by-default - extrapolating out the world as it would be without any further actions - you see that the bill not being paid, and interest charges accruing on your credit card.&#xA0; So you pay the bill online.&#xA0; And now, <em>imagining</em> tomorrow, it seems to you that the interest charges will not occur.&#xA0; So at 1:00pm, you imagined a future in which your credit card accrued interest charges, and at 1:02pm, you imagined a future in which it did not.&#xA0; And so your imagination of the future changed, from one time to another.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/reductionism.html">remarked previously</a>:&#xA0; The way a belief <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/algorithm-feels.html">feels from inside</a>, is that you seem to be <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/mind-projection.html">looking straight at reality</a>.&#xA0; When it actually <em>seems</em> that you're looking at a belief, as such, you are really <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/qualitatively-c.html">experiencing a belief about your beliefs</a>.</p>
<p>When your <em>extrapolation</em> of the future changes, from one time to another, it <em>feels </em>like the future itself is changing.&#xA0; Yet you have never <em>seen</em> the future change.&#xA0; When you actually <em>get to </em>the future, you only ever see one outcome.</p>
<p>How could a single moment of time, change from one time to another?</p>
<p>I am not going to go into "free will" in today's blog post.&#xA0; Except to remark that if you have been reading Overcoming Bias all this time, and you are currently agonizing about whether or not you <em>really have free will,</em> instead of trying to <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/dissolving-the.html">understand where your own mind has become confused</a> and generated an <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/wrong-questions.html">impossible question</a>, you should probably go back and read it all again.&#xA0; For anyone who is just now joining us... perhaps I shall discuss the issue tomorrow.</p>
<p>Just remember Egan's Law:&#xA0; <em>It all adds up to normality.</em>&#xA0; Apples didn't stop falling when Einstein disproved Newton's theory of gravity, and anyone who jumped off a cliff would still go splat.&#xA0; Perhaps Time turns out to work differently than you thought; but tomorrow still lies ahead of you, and your choices, and their consequences.&#xA0; I wouldn't advise reworking your moral philosophy based on confusing arguments and strange-seeming physics, until <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/quantum-explana.html">the physics stops appearing strange</a> and the arguments <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/dissolving-the.html">no longer seem confusing</a>.</p>
<p>Now to physics we turn; and here I resume drawing my ideas from Julian Barbour.</p>
<p>For the benefit of anyone who hasn't followed the series on quantum mechanics, a very <em>very</em> quick summary:</p>
<ul><li>In classical physics - the <em>mistaken</em> physics that was developed first historically, and matches human intuitions all <em>too</em> well - a particle is like a little billiard ball.&#xA0; A particle is in a single place in 3D space, and we can describe its position with three real numbers.&#xA0; In <em>quantum</em> physics, we need an <em>amplitude distribution</em> over all possible positions for the particle - a complex number for the particle being <em>here,</em> a complex number for the particle being <em>there,</em> and so on through all the positions in space; a continuous distribution.&#xA0; (<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/configurations.html">Configurations and Amplitude.</a>)</li>
<li>In classical physics, we can consider each particle independently.&#xA0; <em>This</em> particle is <em>here,</em> <em>that</em> particle is <em>there</em>.&#xA0; In quantum physics this is not possible; we can only assign amplitudes to <em>configurations</em> that describe the simultaneous positions of many particles.&#xA0; In fact, the only mathematical entities that actually have amplitudes are joint configurations of all the particles in the entire universe.&#xA0; (<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/joint-configura.html">Joint Configurations.</a>)</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourconfigurationcube_3.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourconfigurationcube_3.png" title="Jbarbourconfigurationcube_3" height="313" width="333" alt="Jbarbourconfigurationcube_3" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>Above is a diagram that shows what a <em>configuration space</em> might look like for three particles, A, B, and C.&#xA0; ABC form a triangle in two-dimensional space.&#xA0; Every individual point in the configuration space corresponds to a simultaneous position of <em>all</em> the particles - above we see points that correspond to particular triangles i.e. joint positions of A, B, and C.&#xA0; (<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/conf-space.html">Classical Configuration Spaces</a>; <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/quantum-arena.html">The Quantum Arena</a>.)

</p>
<p>The <em>state of a quantum system</em> is not a <em>single point</em> in this space; it is a <em>distribution</em> over this space.&#xA0; You could imagine it as a cloud, or a blob, or a colored mist within the space.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourrelative.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourrelative.png" title="Jbarbourrelative" height="326" width="338" alt="Jbarbourrelative" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>Here we see a <em>relative</em> configuration space, in which each axis is the distance between a pair of particles.&#xA0; This has some advantages I'm not going to recapitulate (it was covered in a <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/relative-config.html">previous post</a>), so if you're dropping into the middle of the series, just pretend it's a regular configuration space.

</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtriangleland1.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtriangleland1.png" title="Jbarbourtriangleland1" height="334" width="334" alt="Jbarbourtriangleland1" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>We've just chopped up the pyramidal space you saw before, into a series of slices.&#xA0; In this configuration space, the slices near the bottom show all the particles close together (tiny triangles).&#xA0; As we rise up, the particles get further apart (larger triangles).</p>
<p>At the very bottom of the configuration space is a configuration where all the particles occupy the same position.</p>
<p>(But remember, it's nonsense to talk about an <em>individual particle</em> being anywhere in a <em>configuration space</em> - each point in the configuration space corresponds to a position of all the particles.&#xA0; Configuration space is not the 3D space you know.&#xA0; It's not that there are a bunch of particles resting in the same place at the bottom.&#xA0; The single bottom point <em>corresponds to</em> all the particles being in the same place in 3D space.)

</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtrianglecloud_2.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtrianglecloud_2.png" title="Jbarbourtrianglecloud_2" height="233" width="267" alt="Jbarbourtrianglecloud_2" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>Here we take a closer look at one of the slices of configuration space, and see a cloud of blue and red mist covering some of it.&#xA0; (Why am I only showing the cloud covering a sixth (exactly a sixth) of the triangle?&#xA0; This has to do with a symmetry in the space - exchanges of identical particles - which is not important to the present discussion.)

</p>
<p>But there is your glimpse of some quantum mist - in two colors, because amplitudes are complex numbers with a real and imaginary part.&#xA0; An amplitude distribution or "wavefunction" assigns a complex number to every point in the continuous configuration space - a complex number to every possible configuration of all the particles.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I finished by asking how the state of a quantum system might evolve over <em>time.</em></p>
<p>You might be tempted to visualize the mist churning and changing colors, as quantum amplitude flows within the configuration space.</p>
<p>And this is <em>indeed</em> the way that you would visualize <em>standard </em>physics.</p>
<p>Behold the standard Schr&#xF6;dinger Equation:</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/schrodinger.gif"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/schrodinger.gif" title="Schrodinger" height="78" width="456" alt="Schrodinger" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>Here <em>&#x3C8;</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <em>t</em>) is the amplitude distribution over configuration space (<strong>r</strong>) and time (<em>t</em>).&#xA0; The left-hand side of the Schr&#xF6;dinger Equation is the <em>change over time</em> of the wavefunction &#x3C8;, and the right-hand-side shows how to calculate this change as the sum of two terms:&#xA0; The gradient of the wavefunction over configuration space (at that time), and the potential energy of each configuration.

</p>
<p>Which is to say, the derivative in <em>time</em> of the wavefunction - the instantaneous rate of change - can be in terms of the wavefunction's derivative in <em>space,</em> plus a term for the potential energy.</p>
<p>If you tried to visualize Schr&#xF6;dinger's Equation - doesn't look too hard, right? - you'd see a blob of churning, complex mist in configuration space, with little blobs racing around and splitting into smaller blobs as waves propagated.</p>
<p>If you tried to calculate the quantum state of a <em>single</em> hydrogen atom <em>over time,</em> apart from the rest of the universe - which you can only really do if the hydrogen atom <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/decoherence.html">isn't entangled with anything</a> - the atom's quantum state would evolve over time; the mist would churn.</p>
<p>But suppose you think about the whole universe at once, including yourself, of course.&#xA0; Because - even in the standard model of quantum physics! - that is exactly the arena in which quantum physics takes place:&#xA0; A wavefunction over <em>all</em> the particles, <em>everywhere.</em></p>
<p>If you can sensibly talk about the quantum state of some particular hydrogen atom, it's only because the wavefunction happens to neatly factor into (hydrogen atom) * (rest of world).</p>
<p>Even if the hydrogen atom is behaving in a very regular way, the <em>joint </em>wavefunction for (hydrogen atom * rest of world) may not be so regular.&#xA0; Stars move into new positions, people are born and people die, digital watches tick, and the cosmos expands:&#xA0; The universe is non-recurrent.</p>
<p>Think of how the <em>universal </em>wavefunction <em>&#x3C8;</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <em>t</em>) might behave when <strong>r</strong> is the position of <em>all </em>the particles in the universe.</p>
<p>Let's call 9:00am the time <em>t</em>=0, measured in seconds.</p>
<p>At <em>&#x3C8;</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <em>t</em>=0), then, you are wondering what time it is:&#xA0; The particles making up the neurons in your brain, are in positions <strong>r</strong><sub>you</sub> that <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/brain-breakthro.html">correspond to neurons firing in the thought-pattern</a> "What time is it?"&#xA0; And the Earth, and the Sun, and the rest of the universe, have their own particles in the appropriate <strong>r</strong><sub>rest-of-universe</sub>.&#xA0; Where the complete <strong>r</strong> roughly factorizes as the product (<strong>r</strong><sub>you</sub> * <strong>r</strong><sub>rest-of-universe</sub>).</p>
<p>Over the next second, the joint wavefunction of the entire universe evolves into <em>&#x3C8;</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <em>t</em>=1).&#xA0; All the stars in the sky have moved a little bit onward, in whatever direction they're heading; the Sun has burned up a little more of its hydrogen; on Earth, an average of 1.8 people have died; and you've just glanced down at your watch.</p>
<p>At <em>&#x3C8;</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <em>t</em>=2), the stars have moved a little onward, the galaxies have rotated, the cosmos has expanded a little more (and its expansion has accelerated a little more), your watch has evolved into the state of showing 9:00:02 AM on its screen, and your own mind has evolved into the state of thinking the thought, "Huh, I guess it's nine o' clock."</p>
<p>Ready for the next big simplification in physics?</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p>We don't need the <em>t</em>.</p>
<p>It's redundant.</p>
<p dragover="true">The <strong>r</strong> never repeats itself.&#xA0; The universe is expanding, and in every instant, it gets a little bigger.&#xA0; We don't <em>need </em>a separate <em>t</em> to keep things straight.&#xA0; When you're looking at the whole universe, a unique function <em>&#x3C8;</em> of (<strong>r</strong>, <em>t</em>) is pretty much a unique function of <strong>r</strong>.</p>
<p dragover="true">And the only way <em>we know in the first place</em> "what time it is", is by looking at clocks.&#xA0; And whether the clock is a wristwatch, or the expansion of the universe, or <em>your own memories</em>, that clock is encoded in the position of particles - in the <strong>r</strong>.&#xA0; We have never seen a <em>t</em> variable apart from the <strong>r</strong>.</p>
<p dragover="true"><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/27/jbarbourrelative.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/27/jbarbourrelative.png" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" title="Jbarbourrelative" height="218" width="226" alt="Jbarbourrelative" border="0"></a>
We can recast the quantum wave equations, specifying the time evolution of <em>&#x3C8;</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <em>t</em>), as specifying relations <em>within</em> a wavefunction &#x3C8;(<strong>r</strong>).</p>
<p dragover="true">Occam's Razor:&#xA0; Our equations don't need a <em>t</em> in them, so we can banish the <em>t</em> and make our ontology that much simpler.</p>
<p dragover="true">An <em>unchanging</em> quantum mist hangs over the configuration space, not churning, not flowing.</p>
<p dragover="true">But the mist has internal structure, internal relations; and these contain time <em>implicitly.</em></p>
<p dragover="true">The dynamics of physics - falling apples and rotating galaxies - is now embodied <em>within</em> the unchanging mist in the unchanging configuration space.</p>
<p dragover="true">This landscape is not <em>frozen</em> like a cryonics patient suspended in liquid nitrogen.&#xA0; It is not motionless as an isolated system while the rest of the universe goes on without it.</p>
<p dragover="true">The landscape is <em>timeless</em>; time exists only <em>within</em> it.&#xA0; To talk about time, you have to talk about relations <em>inside </em>the configuration space.</p>
<p dragover="true">Asking "What happened before the Big Bang?" is revealed as a <em>wrong question</em>.&#xA0; There is no "before"; a "before" would be outside the configuration space.&#xA0; There was never a pre-existing emptiness into which our universe exploded.&#xA0; There is just this timeless mathematical object, time existing <em>within</em> it; and the object has a natural boundary at the Big Bang.&#xA0; You cannot ask "<em>When </em>did this mathematical object come into existence?" because there is no <em>t</em> outside it.

</p>
<p dragover="true">So that is Julian Barbour's proposal for the next great simplification project in physics.</p>
<p dragover="true">(And yes, you can not only fit General Relativity into this paradigm, it actually comes out looking <em>even more elegant than before.</em>&#xA0; For which point I refer you to Julian Barbour's <a dragover="true" href="http://www.platonia.com/papers.html">papers</a>.)</p>
<p dragover="true">Tomorrow, I'll go into some of my own thoughts and reactions to this proposal.</p>
<p dragover="true">But one point seems worth noting immediately:&#xA0; I have spoken before on the apparently <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/04/universal_law.html">perfect universality of physical laws</a>, that apply everywhere and everywhen.&#xA0; We have just raised this perfection to an even higher pitch: <strong>everything that exists is either <em>perfectly global</em> or <em>perfectly local</em></strong>.&#xA0; There are points in configuration space that affect only their immediate neighbors in space and time; governed by universal laws of physics.&#xA0; Perfectly local, perfectly global.&#xA0; If the meaning and <em>sheer beauty</em> of this statement is not immediately obvious, I'll go into it tomorrow.</p>
<p dragover="true">And a final intuition-pump, in case you haven't yet gotten timelessness on a gut level...</p>
<p><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/27/manybranches4.png" title="Manybranches4" height="228" width="378" alt="Manybranches4" border="0">
</p>
<p>Think of this as a diagram of the <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/many-worlds-one.html">many worlds</a> of quantum physics.&#xA0; The branch points could be, say, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/on-being-decohe.html">your observation of a particle</a> that seems to go either "left" or "right".</p>
<p dragover="true">Looking back from the vantage point of the gold head, you only <em>remember</em> having been the two green heads.</p>
<p dragover="true">So you seem to remember Time proceeding along a <em>single line</em>.&#xA0; You remember that the particle first went left, and then went right.&#xA0; You ask, "Which way will the particle go <em>this </em>time?"</p>
<p dragover="true">You only remember one of the two outcomes that occurred on each occasion.&#xA0; So you ask, "When I make my next observation, which of the two possible worlds will <em>I</em> end up in?"</p>
<p dragover="true">Remembering only a single line as your past, you try to extend that line into the future -</p>
<p dragover="true">But both branches, both future versions of you, just <em>exist.</em>&#xA0; There <em>is no fact of the matter</em> as to "which branch you go down".&#xA0; Different versions of you experience both branches.</p>
<p dragover="true">So that is many-worlds.</p>
<p dragover="true">And to incorporate Barbour, we simply say that all of these heads, all these Nows, <em>just exist.&#xA0; </em>They do not appear and then vanish; they just <em>are</em>.&#xA0; &#xA0;From a global perspective, there <em>is no answer</em> to the question, "What time is it?"&#xA0; There are just different experiences at different Nows.</p>
<p dragover="true">From any given vantage point, you look back, and remember other times - so that the question, "Why is it <em>this</em> time right now, rather than some <em>other </em>time?" seems to make sense.&#xA0; But there is no answer.</p>
<p dragover="true">When I came to this understanding, I forgot the meaning that Time had once held for me.</p>
<p dragover="true">Time has <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/dissolving-the.html">dissolved</a> for me, has been <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/reductionism.html">reduced</a> to something simpler that is not itself timeful.</p>
