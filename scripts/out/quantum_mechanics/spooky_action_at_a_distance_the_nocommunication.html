</em><strong>Previously in series</strong>:&#xA0; <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/bells-theorem-n.html">Bell's Theorem: No EPR "Reality"</a> </p>
<p>When you have a pair of <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/entangled-photo.html">entangled particles</a>, such as oppositely <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/projection.html">polarized</a> photons, one particle seems to somehow "know" the result of distant measurements on the other particle.&#xA0; If you measure photon A to be polarized at 0&#xB0;, photon B somehow immediately knows that it should have the opposite polarization of 90&#xB0;.</p>
<p>Einstein famously called this "spukhafte Fernwirkung" or "spooky action at a distance".&#xA0; Einstein didn't know about <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/on-being-decohe.html">decoherence</a>, so it seemed spooky to him.</p>
<p>Though, to be fair, Einstein knew perfectly well that the universe couldn't <em>really</em> be "<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/think_like_real.html">spooky</a>".&#xA0; It was a then-popular interpretation of QM that Einstein was calling "spooky", not the universe itself.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Let us first consider how entangled particles <em>look,</em> if you don't know about decoherence - the reason why Einstein called it "spooky":</p>
<p>Suppose we've got oppositely polarized photons A and B, and you're about to measure B in the 20&#xB0; basis.&#xA0; Your probability of seeing B transmitted by the filter (or absorbed) is 50%.</p>
<p>But wait!&#xA0; Before you measure B, I suddenly measure A in the 0&#xB0; basis, and the A photon is transmitted!&#xA0; Now, apparently, the probability that you'll see B transmitted is 11.6%.&#xA0; Something has changed!&#xA0; And even if the photons are light-years away, spacelike separated, the change still occurs.</p>
<p>You might try to reply:</p><blockquote><p>"No, nothing has <em>changed</em> - measuring the A photon has <em>told</em> you something about the B photon, you have gained <em>knowledge,</em> you have carried out an <em>inference</em> about a distant object, but no physical influence travels faster-than-light.</p>
<p>"Suppose I put two index cards into an envelope, one marked '+' and one marked '-'.&#xA0; Now I give one envelope to you, and one envelope to a friend of yours, and you get in a spaceship and travel a few light-years away from each other, and then you open your envelope and see '+'.&#xA0; At once you know that your friend is holding the envelope marked '-', but this doesn't mean the envelope's content has <em>changed</em> faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>"You are committing a Mind Projection Fallacy; the envelope's content is constant, only your local beliefs about distant referents change."</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/bells-theorem-n.html">Bell's Theorem</a>, covered yesterday, shows that this reply fails.&#xA0; It is <em>not possible</em> that each photon has an unknown but fixed individual tendency to be polarized a particular way.&#xA0; (Think of how unlikely it would seem, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/identical-parti.html">a priori</a>, for this to be something <em>any</em> experiment could tell you!)</p>
<p>Einstein didn't know about Bell's Theorem, but the theory he was criticizing did not say that there were hidden variables; it said that the probabilities changed directly.</p>
<p>But then how fast does this influence travel?&#xA0; And what if you measure the entangled particles in such a fashion that, in their individual reference frames, each measurement takes place before the other?</p>
<p>These experiments have been <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wiC0SEdQ454C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=%22no-signaling+condition%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=XtJFSuDyk1&amp;sig=qI8uQcTZnKyiekZwCa68omvYxpQ&amp;hl=en#PPA204,M1">done</a>.&#xA0; If you think there is an influence traveling, it travels at least six million times as fast as light (in the reference frame of the Swiss Alps).&#xA0; Nor is the influence fazed if each measurement takes place "first" within its own reference frame.</p>
<p>So why <em>can't</em> you use this mysterious influence to send signals faster than light?</p>
<p>Here's something that, as a kid, I couldn't get anyone to explain to me:&#xA0; "Why can't you signal using an entangled pair of photons that both start out polarized up-down?&#xA0; By measuring A in a diagonal basis, you destroy the up-down polarization of both photons.&#xA0; Then by measuring B in the up-down/left-right basis, you can with 50% probability detect the fact that a measurement has taken place, if B turns out to be left-right polarized."</p>
<p>It's particularly annoying that nobody gave me an answer, because the answer turns out to be simple:&#xA0; If both photons have definite polarizations, they aren't <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/entangled-photo.html">entangled</a>.&#xA0; There are just two different photons that both happen to be polarized up-down.&#xA0; Measuring one photon doesn't even change your <em>expectations</em> about the other.</p>
<p>Entanglement is not an <em>extra</em> property that you can just stick onto otherwise normal particles!&#xA0; It is a breakdown of quantum independence.&#xA0; In classical probability theory, if you know two facts, there is no longer any logical dependence left between them.&#xA0; Likewise in quantum mechanics, two particles each with a definite state must have a factorizable amplitude distribution.</p>
<p>Or as old-style quantum theory put it:&#xA0; Entanglement requires superposition, which implies uncertainty.&#xA0; When you measure an entangled particle, you are not able to force your measurement result to take any particular value.&#xA0; So, over on the B end, if they do not know <em>what</em> you measured on A, their probabilistic <em>expectation</em> is always the same as before.&#xA0; (So it was once said).</p>
<p>But in old-style quantum theory, there was indeed a real and instantaneous change in the other particle's statistics which took place as the result of your own measurement.&#xA0; It had to be a real change, by Bell's Theorem and by the invisibly assumed <em>uniqueness</em> of both outcomes.</p>
<p>Even though the old theory invoked a non-local influence, you could never use this influence to <em>signal</em> or <em>communicate</em> with anyone.&#xA0; This was called the "no-signaling condition" or the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_communication_theorem">no-communication theorem</a>".</p>
<p dragover="true">Still, on then-current assumptions, they couldn't actually call it the "no influence of any kind whatsoever theorem".&#xA0; So Einstein correctly labeled the old theory as "spooky".</p>
<p>In decoherent terms, the impossibility of signaling is much easier to understand:&#xA0; When you measure A, one version of you sees the photon transmitted and another sees the photon absorbed.&#xA0; If you see the photon absorbed, you have not learned any new <em>empirical</em> fact; you have merely discovered which version of yourself "you" happen to be.&#xA0; From the perspective at B, your "discovery" is not even theoretically a fact they can learn; they know that both versions of you exist.&#xA0; When B finally communicates with you, they "discover" which world they themselves are in, but that's all.&#xA0; The statistics at B <em>really</em> haven't changed - the total Born probability of measuring either polarization is still just 50%!</p>
<p>A common defense of the old theory was that Special Relativity was not violated, because no "information" was transmitted, because the superluminal influence was always "random".&#xA0; 
As some<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#xA0;</span><a href="http://www.physicsforums.com/showpost.php?p=1704107&amp;postcount=8">Hans de Vries</a>
fellow points out, information theory says that
"random" data is the most expensive kind of data you can
transmit.&#xA0; Nor is "random" information always useless:&#xA0; If you and I generate a million entangled particles, we can
later measure them to obtain a shared key for use in cryptography - a
highly useful form of information which, by Bell's Theorem, could <em>not</em>
have already been there before measuring.</p>
<p>But wait a minute.&#xA0; Decoherence also lets you generate the shared key.&#xA0; Does decoherence <em>really</em> not violate the spirit of Special Relativity?</p>
<p>Decoherence doesn't allow "signaling" or "communication", but it allows you to generate a highly useful shared key apparently out of nowhere.&#xA0; Does decoherence <em>really</em> have any advantage over the old-style theory on this one?&#xA0; Or are both theories equally obeying Special Relativity in practice, and equally violating the spirit?</p>
<p>A first reply might be:&#xA0; "The shared key is not 'random'.&#xA0; Both you and your friend generate all possible shared keys, and this is a deterministic and local fact; the correlation only shows up when you meet."</p>
<p>But this just reveals a deeper problem.&#xA0; The counter-objection would be:&#xA0; "The measurement that you perform over at A, splits both A and B into two parts, two worlds, which guarantees that you'll meet the right version of your friend when you reunite.&#xA0; That is non-local physics - something you do <em>at A</em>, makes the world <em>at B</em> split into two parts.&#xA0; This is spooky action at a distance, and it too violates the spirit of Special Relativity.&#xA0; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque">Tu quoque</a>!"</p>
<p>And indeed, if you look at our quantum calculations, they are written in terms of <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/joint-configura.html">joint configurations</a>.&#xA0; Which, on reflection, doesn't seem all that local!</p>
<p>But wait - what exactly does the no-communication theorem say?&#xA0; <em>Why</em> is it true?&#xA0; Perhaps, if we knew, this would bring enlightenment.</p>
<p>Here is where it starts getting complicated.&#xA0; I myself don't fully understand the no-communication theorem - there are some parts I think I can see at a glance, and other parts I don't.&#xA0; So I will only be able to explain some of it, and I may have gotten it wrong, in which case I pray to some physicist to correct me (or at least tell me where I got it wrong).</p>
<p>When we did the calculations for <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/entangled-photo.html">entangled polarized photons</a>, with A's polarization measured using a 30&#xB0; filter, we calculated that the initial state</p><blockquote><p>&#x221A;(1/2) * ( [ A=(1 ; 0) &#x2227; B=(0 ; 1) ] - [ A=(0 ; 1) &#x2227; B=(1; 0) ] )</p></blockquote>
<p>would be decohered into a blob for</p><blockquote><p>( -(&#x221A;3)/2 * &#x221A;(1/2) * [ A=(-(&#x221A;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#x2227; B=(0 ; 1) ] )<br>- ( 1/2 * &#x221A;(1/2) * [ A=(-(&#x221A;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#x2227; B=(1; 0) ] )</p></blockquote><p>and symmetrically (though we didn't do this calculation) another blob for</p><blockquote><p>( 1/2 * &#x221A;(1/2) * [ A=(1/2 ; (&#x221A;3)/2) &#x2227; B=(0 ; 1) ] )<br>
- ( (&#x221A;3)/2 * &#x221A;(1/2) * [ A=(1/2 ; (&#x221A;3)/2) &#x2227; B=(1; 0) ] )</p></blockquote><p>These two blobs together add up, linearly, to the initial state, as one would expect.&#xA0; So what changed?&#xA0; At all?</p>
<p>What changed is that the final result at A, for the first blob, is really more like:</p><blockquote><p>(Sensor-A-reads-"ABSORBED") * (Experimenter-A-sees-"ABSORBED") *<br>{ ( -(&#x221A;3)/2 * &#x221A;(1/2) * [ A=(-(&#x221A;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#x2227; B=(0 ; 1) ] )<br>
- ( 1/2 * &#x221A;(1/2) * [ A=(-(&#x221A;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#x2227; B=(1; 0) ] ) }</p></blockquote><p>and correspondingly with the TRANSMITTED blob.</p>
<p>What changed is that one blob in configuration space, was decohered into two <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/decoherence.html">distantly separated blobs</a> that can't interact any more.</p>
<p>As we saw from the <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/heisenberg.html">Heisenberg "Uncertainty Principle"</a>, decoherence is a visible, experimentally detectable effect.&#xA0; That's why we have to shield quantum computers from decoherence.&#xA0; So couldn't the decohering measurement at A, have detectable consequences for B?</p>
<p>But think about how B sees the initial state:</p><blockquote><p>&#x221A;(1/2) * ( [ A=(1 ; 0) &#x2227; B=(0 ; 1) ] - [ A=(0 ; 1) &#x2227; B=(1; 0) ] )</p></blockquote><p>From B's perspective, this state is already "not all that coherent", because no matter what B does, it can't make the A=(1 ; 0) and A=(0 ; 1) configurations cross <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/feynman-paths.html">paths</a>.&#xA0; There's already a sort of decoherence here - a separation that B can't eliminate by any local action at B.</p>
<p>And as we've earlier glimpsed, the basis in which you write the initial state is arbitrary.&#xA0; When you write out the state, it has pretty much the same form in the 30&#xB0; measuring basis as in the 0&#xB0; measuring basis.</p>
<p>In fact, there's nothing preventing you from writing out the initial state with A in the 30&#xB0; basis and B in the 0&#xB0; basis, so long as your numbers add up.</p>
<p>Indeed this is exactly what we <em>did</em> do, when we first wrote out the four terms in the two blobs, and didn't include the sensor or experimenter.</p>
<p>So when A <em>permanently </em>decohered the blobs in the 30&#xB0; basis, from B's perspective, this merely <em>solidified</em> a decoherence that B could have viewed as <em>already</em> existing.</p>
<p>Obviously, this can't change the local evolution at B (he said, waving his hands a bit).</p>
<p>Now this is only a statement about a quantum measurement that <em>just</em> decoheres the amplitude for A into parts, <em>without</em> A itself evolving in interesting new directions.&#xA0; What if there were many particles on the A side, and something happened on the A side that put some of those particles into <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/distinct-config.html">identical configurations</a> via <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/feynman-paths.html">different paths</a>?</p>
<p>This is where <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/heisenberg.html">linearity</a> and <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/the-born-prob-1.html">unitarity</a> come in.&#xA0; The no-communication theorem requires both conditions: in general, violating linearity or unitarity gives you faster-than-light signaling.&#xA0; (And numerous other superpowers, such as <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/">solving NP-complete problems in polynomial time</a>, and possibly <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/complex-wishes.html">Outcome Pumps</a>.)</p>
<p>By linearity, we can consider parts of the amplitude distribution separately, and their evolved states will add up to the evolved state of the whole.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are many particles on the A side, but we count up
every configuration that corresponds to some single fixed state of B - say,
B=(0 ; 1) or B=France, whatever.&#xA0; We'd get a group of components which looked like:</p><blockquote><p>(AA=1 &#x2227; AB=2 &#x2227; AC=Fred &#x2227; B=France) +<br>(AA=2 &#x2227; AB=1 &#x2227; AC=Sally &#x2227; B=France) + ...</p></blockquote><p>Linearity says that we can decompose the amplitude distribution around states of B, and the evolution of the parts will add to the whole.</p>
<p>Assume that the B side stays fixed.&#xA0; Then this component of the distribution that we have just isolated, will not interfere with any <em>other</em> components, because other components have different values for B, so they are not identical configurations.</p>
<p>And unitary evolution says that whatever the measure - the integrated squared modulus - of this component, the total measure is the same after evolution at A, as before.</p>
<p>So <em>assuming</em> that B stays fixed, then anything <em>whatsoever </em>happening at A, won't change the measure of the states at B (he said, waving his hands some more).</p>
<p>Nor should it matter whether we consider A first, or B first.&#xA0; Anything that happens at A, within some component of the amplitude distribution, only <em>depends </em>on the A factor, and only happens <em>to</em> the A factor; likewise with B; so the final <em>joint</em> amplitude distribution should not depend on the order in which we consider the evolutions (and he waved his hands a final time).</p>
<p>It seems to me that from here it should be easy to show no communication considering the simultaneous evolution of A and B.&#xA0; Sadly I can't quite see the last step of the argument.&#xA0; I've spent very little time doing actual quantum calculations - this is not what I do for a living - or it would probably be obvious.&#xA0; Unless it's more subtle than it appears, but anyway...</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>if I'm not mistaken</em> - though I'm feeling my way here by mathematical intuition - the no-communication theorem manifests as invariant generalized<em>&#xA0;</em>states of entanglement.&#xA0; From B's perspective, they are entangled with some distant entity A, and that entanglement has an invariant shape that remains exactly the same no matter what happens at A.</p>
<p>To me, at least, this suggests that the <em>apparent non-locality of quantum physics</em> is a <em>mere artifact of the representation</em> used to describe it.</p>
<p>If you write a 3-dimensional vector as "30&#xB0; west of north, 40&#xB0;
upward slope, and 100 meters long," it doesn't mean that the universe
has a basic compass grid, or that there's a global direction of up, or
that reality runs on the metric system.&#xA0; It means you chose a
convenient representation.</p>
<p>Physics, including quantum physics, is relativistically invariant:&#xA0; 
You can pick any relativistic frame you like, redo your calculations,
and always get the same experimental predictions back out.&#xA0; <em>That</em> we know.

</p>
<p>Now it may be that, in the course of doing <em>your</em> calculations, you find it convenient to pick <em>some</em> reference frame, <em>any</em> reference frame, and use that in <em>your</em> math.&#xA0; Greenwich Mean Time, say.&#xA0; This doesn't mean there really <em>is</em> a central clock, somewhere underneath the universe, that operates on Greenwich Mean Time.</p>
<p>The representation we used talked about "joint configurations" of A and B in which the states of A and B were simultaneously specified.&#xA0; This means our representation was not relativistic; the notion of "simultaneity" is arbitrary.&#xA0; We assumed the universe ran on Greenwich Mean Time, in effect.</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of representation would be (1) relativistically invariant, (2) show distant entanglement as invariant, (3) directly represent space-time locality, and (4) evolve each element of the new representation in a way that depended only on an immediate neighborhood of other elements.</p>
<p>But that representation would probably be a <em>lot</em> closer to the <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/which-basis-is.html">Tao</a>.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that a better representation might take its basic mathematical objects as local states of entanglement.&#xA0; I've actually suspected this ever since I heard about holographic physics and the entanglement entropy bound.&#xA0; But that's just raw speculation, at this point.</p>
<p>However, it <em>is</em> important that a fundamental representation be as <em>local</em> and as <em>simple</em> as possible.&#xA0; This is why e.g. "histories of the entire universe" make poor "fundamental" objects, in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>And it's why I find it suspicious to have a representation for calculating quantum physics that talks about a relativistically arbitrary "joint configuration" of A and B, when it seems like each local position has an invariant "distant entanglement" that suffices to determine local evolution.&#xA0; Shouldn't we be able to refactor this representation into smaller pieces?</p>
<p>Though ultimately you do have to retrieve the phenomenon where the experimenters meet again, after being separated by light-years, and discover that they measured the photons with opposite polarizations.&#xA0; Which is provably not something you can get from individual billiard balls bopping around.</p>
<p>I suspect that when we get a <em>representation</em> of quantum mechanics that is local in every way that the physics itself is local, it will be immediately obvious - right there in the representation - that things only happen in one place at a time.</p>
<p>Hence, no faster-than-light communicators.&#xA0; (Dammit!)</p>
<p>Now of course, all this that I have said - all this wondrous normality - relies on the decoherence viewpoint.</p>
<p>It relies on believing that when you measure at A, both possible measurements for A still exist, and are still entangled with B in a way that B sees as invariant.</p>
<p>All the amplitude in the joint configuration is undergoing linear, unitary, local
evolution.&#xA0; None of it vanishes.&#xA0; So the probabilities at B are
always the same from a global standpoint, and there is no supraluminal influence, period.</p>
<p>If you tried to "interpret" things any differently... well, the no-communication theorem would become a<em> lot less obvious</em>.</p></div></div></div>
