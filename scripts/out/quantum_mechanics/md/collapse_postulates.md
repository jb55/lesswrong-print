# Collapse Postulates 

Back when people didn't know about
[macroscopic decoherence](/lw/pu/on_being_decoherent/) aka
many-worlds - before it occurred to anyone that the laws deduced
with such precision for microscopic physics, might apply
universally at all levels - what did people *think*was going on?

The initial reasoning seems to have gone something like:

> "When my calculations showed an amplitude of -1/3*i* for this
> photon to get absorbed, my experimental statistics showed that the
> photon was absorbed around 107 times out of 1000, which is a good
> fit to 1/9, the square of the modulus."

to

> "The amplitude *is* the probability (by way of the squared
> modulus)."

to

> "Once you measure something and *know it didn't happen*, its
> *probability* goes to zero."

Read literally, this implies that knowledge itself - or even
conscious awareness - causes the collapse.  Which was in fact the
form of the theory put forth by Werner Heisenberg!

But people became increasingly nervous about the notion of
importing dualistic language into fundamental physics - as well
they should have been!  And so the original reasoning was replaced
by the notion of an objective "collapse" that destroyed all parts
of the wavefunction except one, and was triggered sometime before
superposition grew to human-sized levels.

Now, once you're supposing that parts of the wavefunction can just
vanish, you might think to ask:

> "Is there only *one*survivor?  Maybe there are many surviving
> worlds, but they survive with a frequency determined by their
> integrated squared modulus, and so the typical surviving world has
> experimental statistics that match the Born rule."

Yet collapse theories considered in modern academia, only postulate
*one* surviving world.  Why?

Collapse theories were devised in a time when it
*simply didn't occur* to any physicists that more than one world
*could* exist!  People took for granted that measurements had
single outcomes - it was an assumption so deep it was invisible,
because it was what they *saw happening.*  Collapse theories were
devised to explain *why measurements had single outcomes*, rather
than (in full generality)
*why experimental statistics matched the Born rule.*

For similar reasons, the "collapse postulates" considered
academically, suppose that collapse occurs *before* any human
beings get superposed.  But experiments are steadily ruling out the
possibility of "collapse" in increasingly large entangled systems. 
Apparently an experiment is
[underway](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/mwi-is-falsifia.html#comment-113632200)
to demonstrate quantum superposition at 50-micrometer scales, which
is bigger than most neurons and getting up toward the diameter of
some human hairs!

So why doesn't someone try jumping ahead of the game, and ask:

> "Say, we keep having to postulate the collapse occurs steadily
> later and later.  What if collapse occurs only once superposition
> reaches planetary scales and substantial divergence occurs - say,
> Earth's wavefunction collapses around once a minute?  Then, while
> the surviving Earths at any given time would *remember*a long
> history of quantum experiments that matched the Born statistics, a
> supermajority of those Earths would begin obtaining non-Born
> results from quantum experiments and then abruptly cease to exist a
> minute later."

Why don't collapse theories like *that* one have a huge academic
following, among the many people who apparently think it's okay for
parts of the wavefunction to just vanish?  Especially given that
experiments are proving superposition in steadily larger systems?

A cynic might suggest that the reason for collapse's continued
support, isn't the *physical plausibility* of having large parts of
the wavefunction suddenly vanish, or the hope of somehow explaining
the Born statistics.  The point is to keep the intuitive appeal of
"I don't remember the measurement having more than one result,
therefore only one thing happened; I don't remember splitting, so
there must be only one of me."  You don't remember dying, so
superposed humans must never collapse.  A theory that dared to
stomp on intuition would be missing the whole point.  You might as
well just move on to decoherence.

So a cynic might suggest.

But surely it is too early to be attacking the motives of collapse
supporters.  That is mere argument ad hominem.  What about the
actual physical plausibility of collapse theories?

Well, first:  Does any collapse theory have any experimental
support?  No.

With that out of the way...

If collapse actually worked the way its adherents say it does, it
would be:

1.  The only
    non-[linear](/lw/pq/the_socalled_heisenberg_uncertainty_principle/)
    evolution in all of quantum mechanics.
2.  The only non-[unitary](/lw/py/the_born_probabilities/)
    evolution in all of quantum mechanics.
3.  The only non-[differentiable](/lw/pw/decoherence_is_pointless/)
    (in fact, discontinuous) phenomenon in all of quantum mechanics.
4.  The only phenomenon in all of quantum mechanics that is
    non-[local](/lw/pr/which_basis_is_more_fundamental/) in the
    configuration space.
5.  The only phenomenon in all of physics that violates
    [CPT symmetry](/lw/pp/decoherence/).
6.  The only phenomenon in all of physics that violates
    [Liouville's Theorem](/lw/o5/the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_and_engines_of/)
    (has a many-to-one mapping from initial conditions to outcomes).
7.  The only phenomenon in all of physics that is acausal /
    non-deterministic /
    [inherently random](/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/).
8.  The only phenomenon in all of physics that is non-local in
    spacetime and
    [propagates an influence faster than light](/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/).

WHAT DOES THE GOD-DAMNED COLLAPSE POSTULATE HAVE TO *DO* FOR
PHYSICISTS TO REJECT IT?  KILL A GOD-DAMNED PUPPY?
