# My Childhood Role Model

When I lecture on the Singularity, I often draw a graph of the
"scale of intelligence" as it appears in everyday life:

[![Mindscaleparochial](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/22/mindscaleparochial.png "Mindscaleparochial")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/22/mindscaleparochial.png)

But this is a rather *parochial* view of intelligence.  Sure, in
everyday life, we only deal socially with other humans - only other
humans are partners in the great game - and so we only
*meet the minds* of intelligences ranging from village idiot to
Einstein.  But what we really need to talk about Artificial
Intelligence or theoretical optima of rationality, is *this*
intelligence scale:

[![Mindscalereal](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/21/mindscalereal.png "Mindscalereal")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/21/mindscalereal.png)

For us humans, it seems that the scale of intelligence runs from
"village idiot" at the bottom to "Einstein" at the top.  Yet the
distance from "village idiot" to "Einstein" is tiny, in the space
of *brain designs. *Einstein and the village idiot both have a
prefrontal cortex, a hippocampus, a cerebellum...

Maybe Einstein has some minor genetic differences from the village
idiot, engine tweaks.  But the brain-design-distance between
Einstein and the village idiot is nothing remotely like the
brain-design-distance between the village idiot and a chimpanzee. 
A chimp couldn't tell the difference between Einstein and the
village idiot, and our descendants may not see much of a difference
either.

Carl Shulman has observed that some academics who talk about
transhumanism, seem to use the following scale of intelligence:

Douglas Hofstadter actually said something like this, at the 2006
Singularity Summit.  He looked at my diagram showing the "village
idiot" next to "Einstein", and said, "That seems wrong to me; I
think Einstein should be way off on the right."

I was speechless.  Especially because this was
*Douglas Hofstadter,* one of my childhood heroes.  It revealed a
[cultural gap](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/inferential-dis.html)
that I had never imagined existed.

See, for me, what you would find toward the right side of the
scale, was a Jupiter Brain.  Einstein did not *literally* have a
brain the size of a planet.

On the right side of the scale, you would find Deep Thought -
Douglas Adams's original version, thank you, not the chessplayer. 
The computer so intelligent that even before its stupendous data
banks were connected, when it was switched on for the first time,
it started from *I think therefore I am* and got as far as deducing
the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed
to shut it off.

Toward the right side of the scale, you would find the Elders of
Arisia, galactic overminds, Matrioshka brains, and the better class
of God.  At the *extreme* right end of the scale, Old One and the
Blight.

Not frickin' Einstein.

I'm sure Einstein was very smart for a human.  I'm sure a General
Systems Vehicle would think that was very cute of him.

I call this a "cultural gap" because I was introduced to the
concept of a Jupiter Brain at the age of twelve.

Now all of this, of course, is
[the logical fallacy of generalization from fictional evidence](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/fictional-evide.html).

But it is an example of why - logical fallacy or not - I suspect
that reading science fiction does have a helpful effect on
futurism.  Sometimes the alternative to a fictional acquaintance
with worlds outside your own, is to have a mindset that is
absolutely
[stuck in one era](http://www.beloit.edu/~pubaff/mindset/2003.php): 
A world where humans exist, and have always existed, and always
will exist.

The universe is 13.7 billion years old, people! 
*Homo sapiens sapiens* have only been around for a hundred thousand
years or thereabouts!

Then again, I have met some people who never read science fiction,
but who do seem able to imagine outside their own world.  And there
are science fiction fans who don't get it.  I wish I knew what "it"
was, so I could bottle it.

Yesterday, I wanted to talk about the *efficient use of evidence,*
i.e., Einstein was cute for a human but in an absolute sense he was
around as efficient as the US Department of Defense.

So I had to talk about
[a civilization that included thousands of Einsteins, thinking for decades](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/faster-than-ein.html). 
Because if I'd just depicted a Bayesian superintelligence in a box,
looking at a webcam, people would think: "But... how does it know
how to interpret a 2D picture?"  They wouldn't put *themselves* in
the shoes of the mere machine, even if it was called a "Bayesian
superintelligence"; they wouldn't apply even their *own* creativity
to the problem of what you could extract from looking at a grid of
bits.

It would just be a ghost in a box, that happened to be called a
"Bayesian superintelligence".  The ghost hasn't been told anything
about how to interpret the input of a webcam; so, in their mental
model, the ghost does not know.

As for whether it's realistic to suppose that one Bayesian
superintelligence can "do all that"... i.e., the stuff that
occurred to me on first sitting down to the problem, writing out
the story as I went along...

Well, let me put it this way:  Remember how
[Jeffreyssai](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/eld-science.html)
pointed out that if the experience of having an important insight
doesn't take more than 5 minutes, this theoretically gives you time
for 5760 insights per month?  Assuming you sleep 8 hours a day and
have no important insights while sleeping, that is.

Now humans cannot use themselves this efficiently.  But humans are
not adapted for the task of scientific research.  Humans are
adapted to chase deer across the savanna, throw spears into them,
cook them, and then - this is probably the part that takes most of
the brains - cleverly argue that they deserve to receive a larger
share of the meat.

It's amazing that Albert Einstein managed to repurpose a brain like
that for the task of doing physics.  This deserves applause.  It
deserves more than applause, it deserves a place in the Guinness
Book of Records.  Like successfully building the fastest car ever
to be made entirely out of Jello.

How poorly did the
[blind idiot god](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/an-alien-god.html)
(evolution) *really* design the human brain?

This is something that can only be grasped through much study of
cognitive science, until the full horror begins to dawn upon you.

All the biases we have discussed here should at least be a hint.

Likewise the fact that the human brain must use its full power and
concentration, with trillions of synapses firing, to multiply out
two three-digit numbers without a paper and pencil.

No more than Einstein made efficient use of his sensory data, did
his brain make efficient use of his neurons firing.

Of course I have certain ulterior motives in saying all this.  But
let it also be understood that, years ago, when I set out to be a
rationalist, the impossible unattainable ideal of intelligence that
inspired me, was never Einstein.

Carl Schurz said:

> "Ideals are like stars. You will not succeed in touching them with
> your hands. But, like the seafaring man on the desert of waters,
> you choose them as your guides and following them you will reach
> your destiny."

So now you've caught a glimpse of one of my great childhood role
models - my dream of an AI.  Only the dream, of course, the reality
not being available.  I reached up to that dream, once upon a
time.

And this helped me to some degree, and harmed me to some degree.

For some ideals are like dreams: they come from within us, not from
outside.  Mentor of Arisia proceeded from E. E. "doc" Smith's
imagination, not from any real thing.  If you imagine what a
Bayesian superintelligence would say, it is only your own mind
talking.  Not like a star, that you can follow from outside.  You
have to guess where your ideals are, and if you guess wrong, you go
astray.

But do not limit your ideals to mere stars, to mere humans who
actually existed, especially if they were born more than fifty
years before you and are dead.  Each
[succeeding generation](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/guardians-of-th.html)
has a chance to
[do better](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/03/tsuyoku_naritai.html).
To let your ideals be composed only of humans, especially dead
ones, is to
[limit yourself to what has already been accomplished](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/guardians-of-th.html). 
You will ask yourself, "Do I dare to do this thing, which Einstein
could not do?  Is this not *lĂ¨se majestĂŠ?*"  Well, if Einstein
had sat around asking himself, "Am I allowed to do better than
Newton?" he would not have gotten where he did.  This is the
problem with following stars; at best, it gets you to the star.

Your era supports you more than you realize, in unconscious
assumptions, in subtly improved technology of mind.  Einstein was a
nice fellow, but he talked a deal of nonsense about an impersonal
God, which shows you how well he understood the art of careful
thinking
[at a higher level of abstraction than his own field](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/01/outside_the_lab.html). 
It may seem less like sacrilege to
[think that](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/eld-science.html),
if you have at least one imaginary galactic supermind to compare
with Einstein, so that he is not the far right end of your
intelligence scale.

If you only try to do what seems humanly possible, you will ask too
little of yourself.  When you imagine reaching up to some higher
and inconvenient goal, all the convenient reasons why it is "not
possible" leap readily to mind.

The most important role models are dreams: they come from within
ourselves.  To dream of anything less than what you conceive to be
perfection, is to draw on less than the full power of the part of
yourself that dreams.
