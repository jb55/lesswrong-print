# Decoherent Essences

In "[Decoherence is Pointless](/lw/pw/decoherence_is_pointless/)",
we talked about quantum states such as

> (Human-BLANK) \* ((Sensor-LEFT \* Atom-LEFT) + (Sensor-RIGHT \*
> Atom-RIGHT))

which describes the evolution of a quantum system just after a
sensor has measured an atom, and right before a human has looked at
the sensor - or before the human has interacted gravitationally
with the sensor, for that matter.  (It doesn't take much
interaction to decohere objects the size of a human.)

But this is only one way of looking at the amplitude distribution -
a way that makes it easy to see objects like humans, sensors, and
atoms.  There are other ways of looking at this amplitude
distribution - different
[choices of basis](/lw/pr/which_basis_is_more_fundamental/) - that
will make the decoherence less obvious.

Suppose that you have the "entangled"
([non-independent](/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/)) state:

> (Sensor-LEFT \* Atom-LEFT) + (Sensor-RIGHT \* Atom-RIGHT)

considering now only the sensor and the atom.

This state looks nicely diagonalized - separated into two distinct
blobs.  But by
[linearity](/lw/pq/the_socalled_heisenberg_uncertainty_principle/),
we can take apart a quantum amplitude distribution any way we like,
and get the same laws of physics back out.  So in a different
basis, we might end up writing (Sensor-LEFT \* Atom-LEFT) as:

> (0.5(Sensor-LEFT + Sensor-RIGHT) + 0.5(Sensor-LEFT - Sensor-RIGHT))
> \* (0.5(Atom-RIGHT + Atom-LEFT) - 0.5(Atom-RIGHT - Atom-LEFT))

(Don't laugh.  There are legitimate reasons for physicists to
reformulate their quantum representations in weird ways.)

The result works out the same, of course.  But if you view the
entangled state in a basis made up of linearly independent
components like (Sensor-LEFT - Sensor-RIGHT) and (Atom-RIGHT -
Atom-LEFT), you see a differently shaped amplitude distribution,
and it may not *look* like the blobs are separated.

Oh noes!  The *decoherence has disappeared!*

...or that's the source of a huge academic literature asking,
"Doesn't the decoherence interpretation require us to choose a
preferred basis?"

To which the short answer is:  Choosing a basis is an isomorphism;
it doesn't change any experimental predictions.  Decoherence is an
experimentally visible phenomenon or we would not have to protect
quantum computers from it.  You can't protect a quantum computer by
"choosing the right basis" instead of using environmental
shielding.  Likewise, looking at splitting humans from another
angle won't make their decoherence go away.

But this is an issue that you're bound to encounter if you pursue
quantum mechanics, especially if you talk to anyone from the Old
School, and so it may be worth expanding on this reply.

After all, if the short answer is as obvious as I've made it sound,
then why, oh why, would anyone ever think you *could* eliminate an
experimentally visible phenomenon like decoherence, by
isomorphically reformulating the mathematical representation of
quantum physics?

That's a bit difficult to describe in one mere blog post.  It has
to do with history.  You know the warning I gave about dragging
*history* into
[explanations of QM](/lw/pc/quantum_explanations/)... so consider
yourself warned:  Quantum mechanics is simpler than the arguments
we have about quantum mechanics.  But here, then, is the history:

Once upon a time,

Long ago and far away, back when the theory of quantum mechanics
was first being developed,

*No one had ever thought of decoherence*.  The question of why a
human researcher only saw one thing at a time, was a Great Mystery
with no obvious answer.

You had to *interpret* quantum mechanics to get an answer back out
of it.  Like reading meanings into an oracle.  And there were
different, competing interpretations.  In one popular
interpretation, when you "measured" a system, the Quantum Spaghetti
Monster would eat all but one blob of amplitude, at some
unspecified time that was exactly right to give you whatever
experimental result you actually saw.

Needless to say, this "interpretation" wasn't *in* the quantum
equations.  You had to add in the *extra* postulate of a Quantum
Spaghetti Monster *on top*, *additionally* to the differential
equations you had fixed experimentally for describing how an
amplitude distribution evolved.

Along came Hugh Everett and said,  "Hey, maybe the formalism just
describes the way the universe *is,* without any need to
'interpret' it."

But people were so used to adding *extra* postulates to interpret
quantum mechanics, and so *unused*to the idea of amplitude
distributions as real, that they couldn't see this new
"interpretation" as anything *except* an additional Decoherence
Postulate which said:

"When clouds of amplitude become separated enough, the Quantum
Spaghetti Monster steps in and *creates a new world* corresponding
to each cloud of amplitude."

So then they asked:

"Exactly how separated do two clouds of amplitude have to be,
[quantitatively speaking](/lw/pv/the_conscious_sorites_paradox/),
in order to invoke the instantaneous action of the Quantum
Spaghetti Monster?  And in which basis does the Quantum Spaghetti
Monster measure separation?"

But, in the *modern* view of quantum mechanics - which is accepted
by everyone except for a handful of old fogeys who may or may not
still constitute a numerical majority - well, as
[David Wallace](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0312157) puts it:

> "If I were to pick one theme as central to the tangled development

> probably be: *the formalism is to be left alone.*"

Decoherence is not an extra phenomenon.  Decoherence is not
something that has to be proposed additionally.  There is no
Decoherence Postulate *on top of* standard QM.  It is implicit in
the standard rules.  Decoherence is just what happens *by default,*
given the standard quantum equations, unless the Quantum Spaghetti
Monster intervenes.

Some still claim that the quantum equations are unreal - a mere
model that just happens to give amazingly good experimental
predictions.  But then decoherence is what happens to the particles
in the "unreal model", if you apply the rules
[universally and uniformly](/lw/hr/universal_law/).  It is
*denying* decoherence that requires you to postulate an extra law
of physics, or an act of the Quantum Spaghetti Monster.

(Needless to say, no one has ever observed a quantum system
behaving coherently, when the untouched equations say it should be
decoherent; nor observed a quantum system behaving decoherently,
when the untouched equations say it should be coherent.)

*If you're talking about anything that isn't in the equations, you must not be talking about "decoherence".*
The standard equations of QM, uninterpreted, do not talk about a
Quantum Spaghetti Monster creating new worlds.  So if you ask when
the Quantum Spaghetti Monster creates a new world, and you can't
answer the question just by looking at the equations, then you must
not be talking about "decoherence".  QED.

Which basis you use in your calculations makes no difference to
standard QM.  "Decoherence" is a phenomenon implicit in standard
QM. Which basis you use makes no difference to "decoherence". 
QED.

Changing your view of the configuration space can change your view
of the blobs of amplitude, but ultimately the same physical events
happen for the same causal reasons.  Momentum basis, position
basis, position basis with a different relativistic space of
simultaneity - it doesn't matter to QM, ergo it doesn't matter to
decoherence.

If this were not so, you could do an experiment to find out which
basis was the right one!  Decoherence is an experimentally visible
phenomenon - that's why we have to protect quantum computers from
it.

Ah, but then where is the decoherence in

> (0.5(Sensor-LEFT + Sensor-RIGHT) + 0.5(Sensor-LEFT - Sensor-RIGHT))
> \* (0.5(Atom-RIGHT + Atom-LEFT) - 0.5(Atom-RIGHT - Atom-LEFT)) +
> (0.5(Sensor-LEFT + Sensor-RIGHT) - 0.5(Sensor-LEFT - Sensor-RIGHT))
> \* (0.5(Atom-RIGHT + Atom-LEFT) + 0.5(Atom-RIGHT - Atom-LEFT))

?

The decoherence is still *there.*  We've just made it harder for a
human to *see,* in the new *representation*.

The main interesting fact I would point to, about this amazing new
representation, is that we can no longer calculate its evolution
with *local causality.*  For a technical definition of what I mean
by "causality" or "local", see Judea Pearl's *Causality*.  Roughly,
to compute the evolution of an amplitude cloud in a
*locally causal* basis, each point in configuration space only has
to look at its infinitesimal neighborhood to determine its
instantaneous change.  As I understand quantum physics - I pray to
some physicist to correct me if I'm wrong - the position basis is
local in this sense.

(Note:  It's okay to pray to physicists, because physicists
[actually exist](/lw/oy/is_humanism_a_religionsubstitute/) and can
answer prayers.)

However, once you start breaking down the amplitude distribution
into components like (Sensor-RIGHT - Sensor-LEFT), then the flow of
amplitude, and the flow of causality, is no longer *local* within
the new configuration space.  You can still calculate it, but you
have to use nonlocal calculations.

In essence, you've obscured the chessboard by subtracting the
queen's position from the king's position.  All the information is
still there, but it's harder to *see*.

When it comes to talking about whether "decoherence" has occurred
in the quantum state of a human brain, what should intuitively
matter is questions like, "Does the event of a neuron firing in
Human-LEFT have a
[noticeable](/lw/pv/the_conscious_sorites_paradox/) influence on
whether a corresponding neuron fires in Human-RIGHT?"  You can
choose a basis that will mix up the amplitude for Human-LEFT and
Human-RIGHT, *in your calculations.*  You cannot, however,
*choose a basis* that makes a human neuron fire when it would not
otherwise have fired; any more than you can *choose a basis* that
will protect a quantum computer without the trouble of shielding,
or *choose a basis* that will make apples fall upward instead of
down, etcetera.

The formalism is to be left alone!  If you're talking about
anything that isn't in the equations, you're not talking about
decoherence!  Decoherence is part of the invariant essence that
doesn't change no matter how you spin your basis - just like the
physical reality of apples and quantum computers and brains.

There may be a kind of
[Mind Projection Fallacy](/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/) at work
here.  A tendency to see the basis itself as real - something that
a Quantum Spaghetti Monster might come in and act upon - because
you spend so much time calculating with it.

In a strange way, I think, this sort of jump is actively encouraged
by the Old School idea that the amplitude distributions
*aren't real.*  If you were told the amplitude distributions were
physically real, you would (hopefully) get in the habit of looking
past mere *representations*, to *see through* to some invariant
essence inside - a reality that doesn't change no matter how you
choose to represent it.

But people are told the amplitude distribution is not real.  The
calculation itself is *all there is*, and has no virtue save its
*mysteriously excellent* experimental predictions.  And so there is
no point in trying to *see through* the calculations to something
within.

Then why *not* interpret all this talk of "decoherence" in terms of
an arbitrarily chosen basis?  Isn't that all there is to
*interpret* - the calculation that you did in some representation
or another?  Why not complain, if - having thus *interpreted*
decoherence - the separatedness of amplitude blobs seems to change,
when you change the basis?  Why try to see through to the neurons,
or the flows of causality, when you've been told that the
calculations are all?

(This notion of *seeing through* - looking for an essence, and not
being distracted by surfaces - is one that pops up
[again](/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/)
and [again](/lw/le/lost_purposes/), and
[again](/lw/js/the_bottom_line/) and
[again](/lw/nv/replace_the_symbol_with_the_substance/) and
[again](/lw/nc/newcombs_problem_and_regret_of_rationality/), in the
Way of Rationality.)

Another possible problem is that the calculations are crisp, but
the essences inside them are not.  Write out an integral, and the
symbols are digitally distinct.  But an entire apple, or an entire
brain, is larger than anything you can handle formally.

Yet the form of that crisp integral will change when you change
your basis; and that sloppy real essence will remain invariant. 
Reformulating your equations won't
[remove a dagger](/lw/ne/the_parable_of_the_dagger/), or silence a
firing neuron, or shield a quantum computer from decoherence.

The phenomenon of decoherence within brains and sensors, may not be
any more crisply defined than the brains and sensors themselves. 
Brains, as high-level phenomena, don't always make a clear
appearance in fundamental equations.  Apples aren't crisp, you
might say.

For historical reasons, some Old School physicists are accustomed
to QM being "interpreted" using extra postulates that involve crisp
actions by the Quantum Spaghetti Monster - eating blobs of
amplitude at a particular instant, or creating worlds as a
particular instant.  Since the equations aren't supposed to be
*real,* the sloppy borders of real things are not looked for, and
the crisp calculations are primary.  This makes it hard to see
through to a real (but uncrisp) phenomenon among real (but uncrisp)
brains and apples, invariant under changes of crisp (but arbitrary)
representation.

Likewise, any change of representation that makes apples harder to
see, or brains harder to see, will make decoherence within brains
harder to see.  But it won't change the apple, the brain, or the
decoherence.

As always, any philosophical problems that result from "brain" or
"person" or "consciousness"
[not being crisply defined](/lw/pv/the_conscious_sorites_paradox/),
are
[not the responsibility of physicists](/lw/pv/the_conscious_sorites_paradox/)
or of any fundamental physical theory. Nor are they limited to
decoherent quantum physics particularly, appearing likewise in
[splitting brains constructed under classical physics](/lw/ps/where_physics_meets_experience/),
etcetera.

Coming tomorrow (hopefully):  *The Born Probabilities*, aka, that
mysterious thing we do with the squared modulus to get our
experimental predictions.
