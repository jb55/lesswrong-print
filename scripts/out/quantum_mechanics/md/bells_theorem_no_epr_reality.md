# Bell's Theorem: No EPR "Reality"

*(Note:  So that this post can be read by people who haven't followed the [whole series](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/quantum-explana.html), I shall temporarily adopt some more standard and less accurate terms; for example, talking about "many worlds" instead of "decoherent blobs of amplitude".)*

The legendary Bayesian, E. T. Jaynes, began his life as a
physicist.  In some of his writings, you can find Jaynes railing
against the idea that, because we have not yet found any way to
predict quantum outcomes, they must be "truly random" or
"inherently random".

Sure, *today*you don't know how to predict quantum measurements. 
But how do you *know,* asks Jaynes, that you won't find a way to
predict the process tomorrow?  How can any
[mere experiments](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/identical-parti.html)
tell us that we'll *never* be able to predict something - that it
is "inherently unknowable" or "truly random"?

As far I can tell, Jaynes never heard about
[decoherence](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/on-being-decohe.html)
aka Many-Worlds, which is a great pity.  If you belonged to a
species with
[a brain like a flat sheet of paper that sometimes split down its thickness](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/physics-meets-e.html),
you could reasonably conclude that you'd *never* be able to
"predict" whether you'd "end up" in the left half or the right
half.  Yet is this really *ignorance*?  It is a *deterministic*fact
that different versions of you will experience different outcomes.

But even if you don't know about Many-Worlds, there's still an
excellent reply for "Why do you think you'll *never* be able to
predict what you'll see when you measure a quantum event?"  This
reply is known as Bell's Theorem.

In 1935,
[Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen](http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v47/i10/p777_1)
once argued roughly as follows:

Suppose we have a pair of
[entangled particles](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/entangled-photo.html),
light-years or at least light-minutes apart, so that no signal can
possibly travel between them over the timespan of the experiment. 
We can suppose these are
[polarized photons](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/projection.html)
with
[opposite polarizations](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/entangled-photo.html).

Polarized filters block some photons, and absorb others; this lets
us measure a photon's polarization in a given orientation. 
Entangled photons (with the right kind of entanglement) are always
found to be polarized in *opposite* directions, when you measure
them in the same orientation; if a filter at a certain angle passes
photon A (*transmits* it) then we know that a filter at the same
angle will block photon B (*absorb* it).

Now we measure one of the photons, labeled A, and find that it is
*transmitted*by a 0° polarized filter.  *Without measuring B,*we
can now predict with
[certainty](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/infinite-certai.html)
that B will be *absorbed*by a 0° polarized filter, because A and B
always have opposite polarizations when measured in the same
basis.

Said EPR:

> "If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with
> certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a
> physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality
> corresponding to this physical quantity."

EPR then assumed (correctly!) that nothing which happened at A
could *disturb* B or exert any influence on B, due to the spacelike
separations of A and B.  We'll take up the relativistic viewpoint
again tomorrow; for now, let's just note that this assumption is
correct.

If by measuring A at 0°, we can predict with certainty whether B
will be absorbed or transmitted at 0°, then according to EPR this
fact must be an "element of physical reality" about B.  Since
measuring A cannot influence B in any way, this element of reality
must *always* have been true of B.  Likewise with every other
possible polarization we could measure - 10°, 20°, 50°, anything. 
If we measured A first in the same basis, even light-years away, we
could perfectly predict the result for B.  So on the EPR
assumptions, there must exist some "element of reality"
corresponding to whether B will be transmitted or absorbed, in
*any* orientation.

But if no one has measured A, quantum theory does *not* predict
with certainty whether B will be transmitted or absorbed.  (At
least that was how it seemed in 1935.)  Therefore, EPR said, there
are elements of reality that exist but are not mentioned in quantum
theory:

> "We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical
> description of physical reality given by wave functions is not
> complete."



This is another excellent example of how
[seemingly impeccable philosophy can fail](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/identical-parti.html)
in the face of experimental evidence, thanks to a wrong assumption
so deep you didn't even realize it was an assumption.

EPR correctly assumed Special Relativity, and then incorrectly
assumed that there was *only one version of you* who saw A do only
one thing.  They assumed that the certain prediction about what
*you* would *hear* from B, described the *only* outcome that
happened at B.

In real life, if you measure A and your friend measures B,
[different versions](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/on-being-decohe.html)
of you and your friend obtain both possible outcomes.  When you
*compare notes,* the two of you always find the polarizations are
opposite.  This does not violate Special Relativity even in spirit,
but the reason why not is the topic of tomorrow's post, not
today's.

Today's post is about how, in 1964,
Belldandy
John S. Bell irrevocably shot down EPR's original argument.  Not by
pointing out the flaw in the EPR assumptions - Many-Worlds was not
then widely known - but by describing an experiment that disproved
them!
It is *experimentally impossible* for there to be a physical
description of the entangled photons, which specifies a single
fixed outcome of any polarization measurement individually
performed on A or B.

This is Bell's Theorem, which rules out all "local hidden variable"
interpretations of quantum mechanics.  It's actually not all that
complicated, as quantum physics goes!

We begin with a pair of
[entangled photons](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/entangled-photo.html),
which we'll name A and B.  When measured in the same basis, you
find that the photons always have opposite polarization - one is
transmitted, one is absorbed.  As for the *first* photon you
measure, the probability of transmission or absorption seems to be
50-50.

What if you measure with polarized filters set at different
angles?

Suppose that I measure A with a filter set at 0°, and find that A
was transmitted.  In general, if you *then* measure B at an angle θ
to my basis, quantum theory says the probability (of my hearing
that) you *also* saw B transmitted, equals sin^2^ θ.  E.g. if your
filter was at an angle of 30° to my filter, and I saw my photon
transmitted, then there's a 25% probability that you see your
photon transmitted.

(Why?  See
"[Decoherence as Projection](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/projection.html)". 
Some quick sanity checks:  sin(0°) = 0, so if we measure at the
same angles, the calculated probability is 0 - we never measure at
the *same* angle and see *both* photons transmitted.  Similarly,
sin(90°) = 1; if I see A transmitted, and you measure at an
orthogonal angle, I will always hear that you saw B transmitted. 
sin(45°) = √(1/2), so if you measure in a diagonal basis, the
probability is 50/50 for the photon to be transmitted or
absorbed.)

Oh, and the initial probability of my seeing A transmitted is
always 1/2.  So the *joint* probability of seeing *both* photons
transmitted is 1/2 \* sin^2^ θ.  1/2 probability of my seeing A
transmitted, times sin^2^ θ probability that you then see B
transmitted.

And now you and I perform three statistical experiments, with large
sample sizes:

(1)  First, I measure A at 0° and you measure B at 20°.  The photon
is transmitted through both filters on 1/2 sin^2^ (20°) = 5.8% of
the occasions.

(2)  Next, I measure A at 20° and you measure B at 40°.  When we
compare notes, we again discover that we both saw our photons pass
through our filters, on 1/2 sin^2^ (40° - 20°) = 5.8% of the
occasions.

(3)  Finally, I measure A at 0° and you measure B at 40°.  Now the
photon passes both filters on 1/2 sin^2^ (40°) = 20.7% of
occasions.

Or to say it a bit more compactly:

1.  A transmitted 0°, B transmitted 20°:  5.8%
2.  A transmitted 20°, B transmitted 40°:  5.8%
3.  A transmitted 0°, B transmitted 40°:  20.7%

What's wrong with this picture?

Nothing, in real life.  But on EPR assumptions, it's impossible.

On EPR assumptions, there's a fixed local tendency for any
individual photon to be transmitted or absorbed by a polarizer of
any given orientation, independent of any measurements performed
light-years away, as the single unique outcome.

Consider experiment (2).  We measure A at 20° and B at 40°, compare
notes, and find we both saw our photons transmitted.  Now, A was
transmitted at 20°, so *if* you had measured B at 20°, B would
certainly have been absorbed - if you measure in the same basis you
must find opposite polarizations.

That is:  If A had the fixed tendency to be transmitted at 20°,
then B must have had a fixed tendency to be absorbed at 20°.  If
this rule were violated, you could have measured both photons in
the 20° basis, and found that both photons had the same
polarization.  Given the way that entangled photons are actually
produced, this would violate conservation of angular momentum.

So (under EPR assumptions) what we learn from experiment (2) can be
*equivalently* phrased as:  "B was a kind of photon that was
transmitted by a 40° filter and *would have been* absorbed by the
20° filter."  Under EPR assumptions this is logically equivalent to
the actual result of experiment (2).

Now let's look again at the percentages:

1.  B is a kind of photon that was transmitted at 20°, and would
    not have been transmitted  at 0°:  5.8%
2.  B is a kind of photon that was transmitted at 40°, and would
    not have been transmitted at 20°:  5.8%
3.  B is a kind of photon that was transmitted at 40°, and would
    not have been transmitted at 0°:  20.7%

If you want to try and see the problem on your own, you can stare
at the three experimental results for a while...

(Spoilers ahead.)

Consider a photon pair that gives us a positive result in
experiment (3).  On EPR assumptions, we now know that the B photon
was inherently a type that would have been absorbed at 0°, and was
in fact transmitted at 40°.  (And conversely, if the B photon is of
this type, experiment (3) will always give us a positive result.)

Now take a B photon from a positive experiment (3), and ask: 
"*If instead* we had measured B at 20°, would it have been
transmitted, or absorbed?"  Again by EPR's assumptions, there must
be a definite answer to this question.  We *could* have measured A
in the 20° basis, and then had certainty of what would happen at B,
without disturbing B.  So there must be an "element of reality" for
B's polarization at 20°.

But if B is a kind of photon that would be transmitted at 20°, then
it is a kind of photon that implies a positive result in experiment
(1).  And if B is a kind of photon that would be absorbed at 20°,
it is a kind of photon that would imply a positive result in
experiment (2).

If B is a kind of photon that is transmitted at 40° *and* absorbed
at 0°, *and* it is *either* a kind that is absorbed at 20° *or* a
kind that is transmitted at 20°; then B must be *either* a kind
that is absorbed at 20° and transmitted at 40°, *or* a kind that is
transmitted at 20° and absorbed at 0°.

So, on EPR's assumptions, it's really hard to see how the same
source can manufacture photon pairs that produce 5.8% positive
results in experiment (1), 5.8% positive results in experiment (2),
and 20.7% positive results in experiment (3).  Every photon pair
that produces a positive result in experiment (3) should also
produce a positive result in either (1) or (2).

"Bell's inequality" is that any theory of hidden local variables
implies (1) + (2) \>= (3).  The experimentally verified fact that
(1) + (2) < (3) is a "violation of Bell's inequality".  So there
are no hidden local variables.  QED.

And that's Bell's Theorem.  See, that wasn't so horrible, was it?

But what's *actually* going on here?

When you measure at A, and your friend measures at B a few
light-years away, different versions of you observe both possible
outcomes - both possible polarizations for your photon.  But the
[amplitude](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/configurations.html)
of the
[joint](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/joint-configura.html)
world where you *both* see your photons transmitted, goes as √(1/2)
\* sin θ where θ is the angle between your polarizers.  So the
[squared modulus](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/configurations.html)
of the amplitude (which is how we get probabilities in quantum
theory) goes as 1/2 sin^2^ θ, and that's the probability for
finding mutual transmission when you meet a few years later and
compare notes.  We'll talk tomorrow about why this doesn't violate
Special Relativity.

Strengthenings of Bell's Theorem eliminate the need for statistical
reasoning:  You can show that local hidden variables are
impossible, using *only*properties of individual experiments which
are *always* true given various measurements.  (Google "GHZ state"
or "GHZM state".)  Occasionally you also hear that someone has
published a strengthened Bell's experiment in which the two
particles were more distantly separated, or the particles were
measured more reliably, but you get the core idea.  Bell's Theorem
is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Now the physicists are
tracking down unreasonable doubts, and Bell always wins.

I know I sometimes speak as if Many-Worlds is a settled issue,
which it isn't academically.  (If people are still arguing about
it, it must not be "settled", right?)  But Bell's Theorem itself is
agreed-upon academically as an experimental truth.  Yes, there are
people discussing theoretically conceivable loopholes in the
experiments done so far.  But I don't think anyone out there
*really* thinks they're going to find an experimental violation of
Bell's Theorem as soon as they use a more sensitive photon
detector.

What does Bell's Theorem plus its experimental verification tell
us, exactly?

My favorite phrasing is one I encountered in
[D. M. Appleby](http://aps.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308114): 
"Quantum mechanics is inconsistent with the classical assumption
that a measurement tells us about a property previously possessed
by the system."

Which is exactly right:  Measurement decoheres your blob of
amplitude (world), splitting it into several noninteracting blobs
(worlds).  This creates new
[indexical uncertainty](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/is-reality-ugly.html)
- uncertainty about which of several versions of yourself you are. 
Learning which version you are, does *not* tell you a previously
unknown property that was always possessed by the system.  And
which specific blobs (worlds) are created, depends on the physical
measuring process.

It's sometimes said that Bell's Theorem rules out "local realism". 
[Tread cautiously when you hear someone arguing against "realism"](http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/truth.html). 
As for *locality*, it is, if anything, far better understood than
this whole "reality" business:  If life is but a dream, it is a
dream that obeys Special Relativity.

It is just one particular sort of locality, and just one particular
notion of which things are "real" in the sense of previously
uniquely determined, which Bell's Theorem says cannot
*simultaneously*be true.

In particular, decoherent quantum mechanics is local, and Bell's
Theorem gives us no reason to believe it is not real.  (It may or
may not be the ultimate truth, but quantum mechanics is certainly
*more* real than the
[classical hallucination](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/no-individual-p.html)
of little billiard balls bopping around.)

*Does Bell's Theorem prevent us from regarding the quantum description as a state of partial knowledge about something more deeply real?*

At the very least, Bell's Theorem prevents us from interpreting
quantum amplitudes as probability in the *obvious*way.  You cannot
point at a single
[configuration](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/configurations.html),
with probability proportional to the squared modulus, and say,
"This is what the universe looked like all along."

In fact, you cannot pick *any* locally specified description
*whatsoever* of unique outcomes for quantum experiments, and say,
"*This* is what we have
[partial information](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/mind-probabilit.html)
about."

So it certainly isn't *easy* to reinterpret the quantum
wavefunction as an uncertain belief.  You can't do it the obvious
way.  And I haven't
[heard of](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/no-one-knows-wh.html)
any *non*-obvious interpretation of the quantum description as
partial information.

Furthermore, as I
[mentioned previously](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/where-experienc.html),
it is really odd to find yourself differentiating a degree of
uncertain anticipation to get physical results - the way we have to
differentiate the quantum wavefunction to find out how it evolves. 
That's not what probabilities are *for.*

Thus I try to
[emphasize](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/mind-probabilit.html)
that quantum amplitudes are *not* possibilities, or probabilities,
or degrees of uncertain belief, or expressions of ignorance, or any
other species of *epistemic* creatures.  Wavefunctions are not
[states of mind](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/mind-projection.html). 
It would be a very
[bad sign](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/philosophy-meet.html)
to have a *fundamental* physics that operated over states of mind;
we know from
[looking at brains](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/brain-breakthro.html)
that
[minds are made of parts](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/angry-atoms.html).

In conclusion, although Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen presented a
picture of the world that was disproven experimentally, I would
still regard them as having won a moral victory:  The then-common
interpretation of quantum mechanics did indeed have a one person
measuring at A, seeing a single outcome, and then making a certain
prediction about a unique outcome at B; and this is indeed
incompatible with relativity, and wrong.  Though people are still
arguing about that.
