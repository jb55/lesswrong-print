# Can You Prove Two Particles Are Identical?

Behold, I present you with two electrons.  They have the same mass.
They have the same charge.  In every way that we've tested them
*so far,* they *seem* to behave the same way.

But is there any way we can know that the two electrons are
*really,* truly, entirely indistinguishable?

The one who is wise in philosophy but not in physics will snort
dismissal, saying, "Of course not.  You haven't found an experiment
*yet* that distinguishes these two electrons.  But who knows, you
might find a new experiment tomorrow that does."

Just because your current model of reality files all observed
electrons in the same mental bucket, doesn't mean that tomorrow's
physics will do the same.  That's mixing up the map with the
territory.  Right?

It took a while to discover atomic isotopes.  Maybe someday we'll
discover electron isotopes whose masses are different in the 20th
decimal place.  In fact, for all we know, the electron has a tiny
little tag on it, too small for your current microscopes to see,
reading 'This is electron \#7,234,982,023,348...'  So that you
could in principle toss this one electron into a bathtub full of
electrons, and then fish it out again later.  Maybe there's some
way to know in principle, maybe not - but for now, surely, this is
one of those things that
[science just doesn't know](/lw/kj/no_one_knows_what_science_doesnt_know/).

That's what you would think, if you were wise in philosophy but not
in physics.

But what kind of universe could you possibly live in, where a
simple experiment can tell you whether it's possible *in principle*
to tell two things apart?

Maybe aliens gave you a tiny little device with two tiny little
boxes, and a tiny little light that goes on when you put two
identical things into the boxes?

But how do you know that's what the device *really* does?  Maybe
the device was just built with measuring instruments that go to the
10th decimal place but not any further.

Imagine that we take this problem to an analytic philosopher named
Bob, and Bob says:

Yes, we've heard of the problem of induction.  Though the Sun has
risen on billions of successive mornings, we can't know with
[absolute certainty](/lw/mn/absolute_authority/) that, tomorrow,
the Sun will not transform into a giant chocolate cake.  But for
the Sun to transform to chocolate cake requires more than an
unanticipated discovery in physics.  It requires the observed
universe to be a lie.  Can any experiment give us an
*equally strong level* of assurance that two particles are
identical?

Why?

Oh, but Bob, now you're just taking your conclusion as a premise. 
What you said is exactly what we want to know.  Is there some
achievable state of evidence, some sequence of discoveries, from
within which you can legitimately expect *never* to discover a
future experiment that distinguishes between two particles?

That's an interesting argument, Bob, but you say you haven't
studied physics.

Maybe you shouldn't be doing all this *philosophical analysis*
before you've studied physics.  Maybe you should beg off the
question, and let a philosopher who's studied physics take over.

> "Would you care to point out a particular flaw in my logic?"

Oh... not at the moment.  We're just saying, You Are Not A
Physicist.  Maybe you shouldn't be so glib when it comes to saying
what physicists can or can't know.

*Impossible* to imagine?  You don't know that.  You just know you
haven't imagined such an experiment yet.  But perhaps that simply
demonstrates a limit on your imagination, rather than demonstrating
a limit on physical possibility.  Maybe if you knew a little more
physics, you would be able to conceive of such an experiment?

And of course, Bob is wrong.

Bob isn't being stupid.  He'd be right in any classical universe. 
But we don't live in a classical universe.

Our ability to perform an experiment that tells us positively that
two particles are entirely identical, goes right to the heart of
what distinguishes the quantum from the classical; the core of what
separates the way reality actually works, from anything any
pre-20th-century human ever imagined about how reality might work.

If you have a particle P1 and a particle P2, and it's possible in
the experiment for both P1 and P2 to end up in either of two
possible locations L1 or L2, then the observed distribution of
results will depend on whether "P1 at L1, P2 at L2" and "P1 at L2,
P2 at L1" is the same configuration, or two distinct
configurations.  If they're the same configuration, we add up the
amplitudes flowing in, then take the squared modulus.  If they're
different configurations, we keep the amplitudes separate, take the
squared moduli separately, then add the resulting probabilities. 
As (1 + 1)^2^ != (1^2^ + 1^2^), it's not hard to distinguish the
experimental results after a few trials.

(Yes, half-integer spin changes this picture slightly.  Which I'm
not going into in this series of blog posts.  If all
epistemological confusions are resolved, half-integer spin is a
difficulty of mere mathematics, so the issue doesn't belong here. 
Half-integer spin doesn't change the experimental testability of
particle equivalences, or alter the fact that particles have no
individual identities.)

And the flaw in Bob's logic?  It was a fundamental assumption that
Bob couldn't even see, because he had no alternative concept for
contrast.  Bob talked about particles P1 and P2 as if they were
individually real and independently real.  This turns out to assume
that which is to be proven.  In our universe, the individually and
fundamentally real entities are configurations of multiple
particles, and the amplitude flows between them.  Bob failed to
imagine the sequence of experimental results which established to
physicists that this was, in fact, how reality worked.

Bob failed to imagine the evidence which falsified his basic and
invisibly assumed ontology - the discoveries that changed the whole
nature of the game; from a world that was the sum of individual
particles, to a world that was the sum of amplitude flows between
multi-particle configurations.

And so Bob's careful philosophical reasoning ended up around as
useful as Kant's conclusion that space, by its very nature, was
flat.  Turned out, Kant was just reproducing an invisible
assumption built into how his parietal cortex was modeling space. 
Kant's imaginings were evidence only about his imagination - grist
for cognitive science, not physics.

Be careful not to underestimate, through
[benefit of hindsight](/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/), how
*surprising* it would seem, a priori, that you could perfectly
identify two particles through experiment.  Be careful not to
underestimate how entirely and perfectly *reasonable* Bob's
analysis would have seemed, if you didn't have quantum assumptions
to contrast to classical ones.

Experiments tell us things about the nature of reality which you
*just plain wouldn't expect* from *a priori* reasoning. 
Experiments falsify assumptions we can't even see. Experiments tell
us how to do things that seem logically impossible. Experiments
deliver surprises from blind spots we don't even know exist.

Bear this in mind, the next time you're wondering whether
*mere empirical science* might have something *totally unexpected*
to say about some impossible-seeming *philosophical* question.
