# Timeless Identity

People have asked me, "What practical good does it do to discuss
quantum physics or consciousness or zombies or personal identity? 
I mean, what's the application for me in real life?"

Before the end of today's post, we shall see a real-world
application with practical consequences, for you, yes, you in
today's world.  It is built upon many prerequisites and deep
foundations;
[you will not be able to tell others what you have seen](/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/),
though you may (or may not) want desperately to tell them.  (Short
of having them read the last several months of OB.)

In [No Individual Particles](/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/) we
saw that the intuitive conception of reality as little billiard
balls bopping around, is entirely and absolutely wrong; the basic
ontological reality, to the best of anyone's present knowledge, is
a joint configuration space.  These configurations have
mathematical identities like "A particle here, a particle there",
rather than "particle 1 here, particle 2 there" and
[the difference is experimentally testable](/lw/ph/can_you_prove_two_particles_are_identical/). 
What might *appear* to be a little billiard ball, like an electron
caught in a trap, is actually a multiplicative *factor* in a
wavefunction that happens to approximately factor.  The
factorization of 18 includes *two* factors of 3, not *one* factor
of 3, but this doesn't mean the two 3s have separate individual
identities - quantum mechanics is sort of like that.  (If that
didn't make any sense to you, sorry; you need to have followed
[the series on quantum physics](/lw/pc/quantum_explanations/).)

In
[Identity Isn't In Specific Atoms](/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms/),
we took this counterintuitive truth of physical ontology, and
proceeded to kick hell out of an intuitive concept of personal
identity that depends on being made of the "same atoms" - the
intuition that you are the same person, if you are made out of the
*same pieces.*  But because the brain doesn't repeat its exact
state (let alone the whole universe), the *joint*configuration
space which underlies you, is nonoverlapping from one fraction of a
second to the next.  Or even from one Planck interval to the next. 
I.e., "you" of now and "you" of one second later do not have in
common any ontologically basic elements with a shared persistent
identity.

Just from standard quantum mechanics, we can see immediately that
some of the standard thought-experiments used to pump intuitions in
philosophical discussions of identity, are *physical nonsense*. 
For example, there is a thought experiment that runs like this:

> "The Scanner here on Earth will destroy my brain and body, while
> recording the exact states of all my cells.  It will then transmit
> this information by radio.  Travelling at the speed of light, the
> message will take three minutes to reach the Replicator on Mars. 
> This will then create, out of new matter, a brain and body exactly
> like mine.  It will be in this body that I shall wake up."

This is Derek Parfit in the excellent *Reasons and Persons,* p. 199
- note that Parfit is describing thought experiments, not
necessarily endorsing them.

There is an argument which Parfit describes (but does not himself
endorse), and which I have seen many people spontaneously invent,
which says (not a quote):

> Ah, but suppose an improved Scanner were invented, which scanned
> you *non-destructively,* but still transmitted the same information
> to Mars* *.  Now, *clearly*, in this case, *you, the original*have
> simply stayed on Earth, and the person on Mars is *only a copy*. 
> Therefore this teleporter is actually murder and birth, not
> *travel*at all - it destroys the original, and constructs a copy!

Well, but who says that if we build an exact copy of you, one
version is the *privileged original* and the other is
*just a copy?*  Are you under the impression that one of these
bodies is constructed out of *the original atoms* - that it has
some kind of physical continuity the other does not possess?  But
there is
[no such thing as a particular atom](/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/),
so the original-ness or new-ness  of the person can't depend on the
original-ness or new-ness of the atoms.

(If you are now saying, "No, you can't distinguish two electrons
*yet*, but that doesn't mean they're the *same entity* -" then you
have not been following the series on quantum mechanics, or you
need to reread it.  Physics does not work the way you think it
does.  There *are no* little billiard balls bouncing around down
there.)

If you further realize that, as a matter of fact,
[you are splitting all the time](/lw/q8/many_worlds_one_best_guess/)
due to [ordinary decoherence](/lw/pu/on_being_decoherent/), then
you are much more likely to look at this thought experiment and
say:  "There is no copy; there are two originals."

Intuitively, in your imagination, it might seem that one billiard
ball stays in the same place on Earth, and another billiard ball
has popped into place on Mars; so one is the "original", and the
other is the "copy".  But at a fundamental level, things are not
made out of billiard balls.

A sentient brain constructed to atomic precision, and copied with
atomic precision, could undergo a quantum evolution along with its
"copy", such that, afterward, there would
*exist no fact of the matter* as to which of the two brains was the
"original".  In some [Feynman diagrams](/lw/pk/feynman_paths/) they
would exchange places, in some Feynman diagrams not.  The two
entire brains would be, in aggregate,
[identical particles](/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/) with no
individual identities.

Parfit, having discussed the teleportation thought experiment,
counters the intuitions of physical continuity with a different set
of thought experiments:

> "Consider another range of possible cases: the
> *Physical Spectrum*.  These cases involve all of the different
> possible degrees of physical continuity...
> 
> "In a case close to the near end, scientists would replace 1% of
> the cells in my brain and body with exact duplicates.  In the case
> in the middle of the spectrum, they would replace 50%.  In a case
> near the far end, they would replace 99%, leaving only 1% of my
> original brain and body.  At the far end, the 'replacement' would
> involve the complete destruction of my brain and body, and the
> creation out of new organic matter of a Replica of me."
> 
> (*Reasons and Persons,*p. 234.)

Parfit uses this to argue against the intuition of physical
continuity pumped by the first experiment: if your identity depends
on physical continuity, where is the exact threshold at which you
cease to be "you"?

By the way, although I'm criticizing Parfit's reasoning here, I
really liked Parfit's discussion of personal identity.  It really
surprised me.  I was expecting a rehash of the same arguments I've
seen on transhumanist mailing lists over the last decade or more. 
Parfit gets *much*further than I've seen the mailing lists get. 
This is a sad verdict for the mailing lists.  And as for
*Reasons and Persons,* it well deserves its fame.

But although Parfit executed his arguments competently and with
great philosophical skill, those two *particular*arguments (Parfit
has lots more!) are doomed by physics.

There just is no such thing as "new organic matter" that has a
persistent identity apart from "old organic matter".  No fact of
the matter exists, as to which electron is which, in your body on
Earth or your body on Mars.  No fact of the matter exists, as to
how many electrons in your body have been "replaced" or "left in
the same place".  So both thought experiments are physical
nonsense.  
Parfit seems to be enunciating his own opinion here (not Devil's
advocating) when he says:

> "There are two kinds of sameness, or identity.  I and my Replica
> are *qualitatively identical,* or exactly alike.  But we may not be
> *numerically identical*, one and the same person.  Similarly, two
> white billiard balls are not numerically but may be qualitatively

> qualitatively identical with itself as it was.  But the red ball
> that I later see and the white ball that I painted red are
> numerically identical.  They are one and the same ball." (p. 201.)

In the human *imagination,* the way we have evolved to imagine
things, we can imagine two qualitatively identical billiard balls
that have a further fact about them - their persistent identity -
that makes them distinct.

But it seems to be a basic lesson of physics that "numerical
identity" *just does not exist.*  Where "qualitative identity"
exists, you can set up quantum evolutions that refute the illusion
of individuality - Feynman diagrams that sum over different
permutations of the identicals.

We should always have been suspicious of "numerical identity",
since it was not
[experimentally](/lw/p9/the_generalized_antizombie_principle/)[detectable](/lw/qm/machs_principle_antiepiphenomenal_physics/);
but physics swoops in and drop-kicks the whole argument out the
window.

Parfit p. 241:

> "Reductionists admit that there is a difference between numerical
> identity and exact similarity.  In some cases, there would be a
> real difference between some person's being me, and his being
> someone else who is merely exactly like me."

*This*reductionist admits no such thing.

Parfit even describes a wise-*seeming* reductionist refusal to
answer questions as to when one person becomes another, when you
are "replacing" the atoms inside them.  P. 235:

> (The reductionist says:)  "The resulting person will be
> psychologically continuous with me as I am now.  This is all there
> is to know.  I do not know whether the resulting person will be me,
> or will be someone else who is merely exactly like me.  But this is
> not, here, a real question, which must have an answer.  It does not
> describe two different possibilities, one of which must be true. 
> It is here an empty question.  There is not a real difference here
> between the resulting person's being *me,* and his being
> *someone else.*  This is why, even though I do not know whether I
> am about to die, I know everything."

Almost but not quite reductionist enough!  When you master quantum
mechanics, you see that, in the thought experiment where your atoms
are being "replaced" in various quantities by "different" atoms,
*nothing whatsoever is actually happening* - the thought experiment
itself is physically empty.

So *this* reductionist, at least, triumphantly says - not, "It is
an empty question; I know everything that there is to know, even
though I don't know if I will live or die" - but simply, "I will
live; nothing happened."

This whole episode is one of the main reasons why I hope that when
I *really* understand matters such as these, and they have ceased
to be mysteries unto me, that I *will* be able to give definite
answers to questions that seem like they ought to have definite
answers.

And it is a reason why I am suspicious, of philosophies that too
early - before the dispelling of mystery - say, "There is no answer
to the question."  Sometimes there *is* no answer, but then the
absence of the answer comes with a shock of understanding, a click
like thunder, that
[makes the question vanish](/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/) in a
puff of smoke.  As opposed to a dull empty sort of feeling, as of
being told to shut up and
[stop asking questions](/lw/it/semantic_stopsigns/).

And another lesson:  Though the thought experiment of having atoms
"replaced" seems *easy to imagine in the abstract,* anyone knowing
a *fully detailed physical visualization* would have immediately
seen that the thought experiment was physical nonsense.  Let
[zombie theorists](/lw/p7/zombies_zombies/) take note!

Additional physics can shift our view of identity even further:

In [Timeless Physics](/lw/qp/timeless_physics/), we looked at a
speculative, but even more beautiful view of quantum mechanics:  We
don't need to suppose the amplitude distribution over the
configuration space is *changing*, since the universe never repeats
itself.  We never see any particular joint configuration (of the
whole universe) change amplitude from one time to another; from one
time to another, the universe will have expanded.  There is just a
timeless amplitude distribution (aka wavefunction) over a
configuration space that includes compressed configurations of the
universe (early times) and expanded configurations of the universe
(later times).

Then we will need to discover people and their identities embodied
within a timeless set of *relations* between configurations that
never repeat themselves, and never change from one time to
another.

As we saw in [Timeless Beauty](/lw/qq/timeless_beauty/), timeless
physics is beautiful because it would make everything that exists
either *perfectly global* - like the uniform, exceptionless laws of
physics that apply everywhere and everywhen - *or perfectly local*
- like points in the configuration space that only affect or are
affected by their immediate local neighborhood.  Everything that
exists fundamentally, would be *qualitatively unique:* there would
never be two *fundamental*entities that have the same properties
but are not the same entity.

(Note:  The you on Earth, and the you on Mars, are not
ontologically basic.  You are *factors* of a joint amplitude
distribution that is ontologically basic.  Suppose the integer 18
exists: the factorization of 18 will include *two* factors of 3,
not *one* factor of 3.  This does not mean that inside the Platonic
integer 18 there are two little 3s hanging around with persistent
identities, living in different houses.)

We also saw in [Timeless Causality](/lw/qr/timeless_causality/)
that the end of time is not necessarily the end of cause and
effect; causality can be defined (and detected statistically!)
without mentioning "time".  This is important because it preserves
arguments about personal identity that rely on *causal* continuity
rather than "physical continuity".

[Previously](/lw/qp/timeless_physics/) I drew this diagram of
*you*in a timeless, branching universe:

[![Manybranches4](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/manybranches4.png "Manybranches4")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/manybranches4.png)

To understand many-worlds:  The gold head only *remembers*the green
heads, creating the illusion of a unique line through time, and the
intuitive question, "Where does the line go next?"  But it goes to
both possible futures, and both possible futures will look back and
see a single line through time.  In many-worlds, there
*is no fact of the matter* as to which future *you personally*will
end up in.  There is no copy; there are two originals.

To understand timeless physics:  The heads are not popping in and
out of existence as some Global Now sweeps forward.  They are all
just there, each thinking that *now* is a different time.

In [Timeless Causality](/lw/qr/timeless_causality/) I drew this
diagram:

[![Causeright](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/causeright.png "Causeright")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/causeright.png)

This was part of an illustration of how we could statistically
distinguish left-flowing causality from right-flowing causality -
an argument that *cause and effect* could be defined relationally,
even the absence of a changing global time.  And I said that,
because we could keep cause and effect as the glue that binds
configurations together, we could go on trying to identify
experiences with *computations* embodied in flows of amplitude,
rather than having to identify experiences with individual
configurations.

But both diagrams have a common flaw: they show discrete nodes,
connected by discrete arrows.  In reality, physics is continuous.

So if you want to know "Where is the computation?  Where is the
experience?" my best guess would be to point to something like a
*directional braid:*

[![Braid\_2](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/braid_2.png "Braid_2")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/braid_2.png)

This is not a braid of moving particles.  This is a braid of
interactions within close neighborhoods of timeless configuration
space.

[![Braidslice](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/braidslice.png "Braidslice")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/braidslice.png)

Every point intersected by the red line is unique as a mathematical
entity; the points are not *moving* from one time to another. 
However, the amplitude at different points is related by physical
laws; and there is a direction of causality to the relations.

You could say that the amplitude is *flowing,* in a river that
never changes, but has a direction.

Embodied in this timeless flow are computations; within the
computations, experiences.  The experiences' computations'
configurations might even overlap each other:

[](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/braidtime.png)

[![Braidtime\_2](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/braidtime_2.png "Braidtime_2")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/06/02/braidtime_2.png)

In the causal relations covered by the rectangle 1, there would be
one moment of Now; in the causal relations covered by the rectangle
2, another moment of Now.  There is a causal direction between
them: 1 is the cause of 2, not the other way around.  The
rectangles overlap - though I really am not sure if I should be
drawing them with overlap or not - because the computations are
embodied in some of the same configurations.  Or if not, there is
still causal continuity because the end state of one computation is
the start state of another.

But on an ontologically fundamental level, nothing with a
persistent identity moves through time.

Even the braid itself is not ontologically fundamental; a human
brain is a *factor* of a larger wavefunction that happens to
factorize.

Then what is preserved from one time to another?  On an
ontologically basic level, absolutely nothing.

But you will recall that I
[earlier](/lw/p9/the_generalized_antizombie_principle/) talked
about any perturbation which does not disturb your internal
narrative, almost certainly not being able to disturb whatever is
the true cause of your saying "I think therefore I am" - this is
why you can't leave a person physically unaltered, and subtract
their consciousness.  When you look at a person on the level of
organization of neurons firing, anything which does not disturb, or
only infinitesimally disturbs, the pattern of neurons firing - such
as flipping a switch from across the room - ought not to disturb
your consciousness, or your personal identity.

If you were to describe the brain on the level of neurons and
synapses, then this description of the factor of the wavefunction
that is your brain, would have *a very great deal in common,*
across different cross-sections of the braid.  The pattern of
synapses would be "almost the same" - that is, the description
would come out almost the same - even though, on an ontologically
basic level, nothing that exists fundamentally is held in common
between them.  The internal narrative goes on, and you can see it
within the vastly higher-level view of the firing patterns in the
connection of synapses.  The *computational* pattern computes, "I
think therefore I am".  The narrative says, today and tomorrow, "I
am Eliezer Yudkowsky, I am a rationalist, and I have something to
protect."  Even though, in the river that never flows, not a single
drop of water is shared between one time and another.

If there's any basis *whatsoever*to this notion of "continuity of
consciousness" - I haven't quite given up on it yet, because I
don't have anything better to cling to - then I would guess that
this is how it works.

Oh... and I promised you a real-world application, didn't I?

Well, here it is:

Many throughout time, tempted by the promise of immortality, have
consumed strange and often fatal elixirs; they have tried to
bargain with devils that failed to appear; and done many other
silly things.

But [like all superpowers](/lw/qs/einsteins_superpowers/),
long-range life extension can only be acquired by seeing, with a
shock, that some way of getting it is *perfectly normal.*

If you can see the moments of *now* braided into time, the causal
dependencies of future states on past states, the high-level
pattern of synapses and the internal narrative as a computation
within it - if you can viscerally dispel the classical
hallucination of a little billiard ball that is you, and see your
*nows* strung out in the river that never flows - then you can see
that signing up for cryonics, being vitrified in liquid nitrogen
when you die, and having your brain nanotechnologically
reconstructed fifty years later, is actually *less* of a change
than going to sleep, dreaming, and forgetting your dreams when you
wake up.

You should be able to *see* that, now, if you've followed through
this whole series.  You should be able to get it on a *gut level* -
that being vitrified in liquid nitrogen for fifty years (around
3e52 Planck intervals) is not very different from waiting an
average of 2e26 Planck intervals between neurons firing, on the
generous assumption that there are a hundred trillion synapses
firing a thousand times per second.  You should be able to *see*
that there is nothing preserved from one night's sleep to the
morning's waking, which cryonic suspension does not preserve also. 
Assuming the vitrification technology is good enough for a
[sufficiently powerful](/lw/qk/that_alien_message/) Bayesian
[superintelligence](/lw/ql/my_childhood_role_model/) to look at
your frozen brain, and figure out "who you were" to the same
resolution that your morning's waking self resembles the person who
went to sleep that night.

Do you know what it takes to *securely* erase a computer's hard
drive?  Writing it over with all zeroes isn't enough.  Writing it
over with all zeroes, then all ones, then a random pattern, isn't
enough.  Someone with the right tools can still examine the final
state of a section of magnetic memory, and distinguish the state,
"This was a 1 written over by a 1, then a 0, then a 1" from "This
was a 0 written over by a 1, then a 0, then a 1".  The best way to
securely erase a computer's hard drive is to destroy it with
thermite.

I really don't think that carefully vitrifying a brain to prevent
ice crystal formation and then freezing it in liquid nitrogen is
going to be a secure erase procedure, if you can examine
atomic-level differences in the synapses.

Someone hears about cryonics and thinks for 10 seconds and says,
"But if you're frozen and then revived, are you
*really the same person?*"

And if they happened to know all about quantum physics
*and could apply the abstract knowledge to real life,* and they had
followed the whole debate about zombies
*and resolved it against epiphenomenalism in general,* then they
would be able to visualize the braids in the river that never
flows, and say, "Yes."

But this knowledge is not common.

So they die.

There are numerous other reasons that people seize on, when they
search for a rationalization for a negative initial flinch against
cryonics.  And numerous other knowledges that would be required to
answer those objections.  "But wouldn't it be boring to live such a
long time?"  (Can be answered if you know hedonic psychology, and
have developed a theory of fun, and can visualize accessible fun
spaces that increase in volume with increasing intelligence.)  "Why
would future civilizations bother to revive me?"  (Requires
understanding either economic growth diminishing the cost, *or*
knowledge of history and how societies have become kinder over
time, *or* knowing about Friendly AI.)  "Isn't it wrong to live so
long?"  (Requires knowing about the "sour grapes" bias.  See also
[transhumanism as simplified humanism](http://www.singinst.org/blog/2007/06/16/transhumanism-as-simplified-humanism/)
and
[the meaning that immortality gives to life](http://www.singinst.org/blog/2007/10/14/the-meaning-that-immortality-gives-to-life/).) 
Then there's the meta-knowledge of how to question all these
[deeply wise](/lw/k8/how_to_seem_and_be_deep/)
[cached thoughts](/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/) that pop into your head
about the futility of life; and the ability to do things that might
make people [look at you weird](/lw/mb/lonely_dissent/), and so
on...

Some of these are series of posts I haven't done yet.  But if you
anticipate updating your probabilities when you read those future
posts, then you should update them now.  Or, if you prefer, trust
me:

If you would rather live happily ever after, than die, and you are
willing to spend between $300 and $2000 per year(\*) to express
this preference, then sign up for cryonics.

If you've been cryocrastinating, putting off signing up for
cryonics "until later", don't think that you've "gotten away with
it so far".  Many worlds, remember?  There are branched versions of
you that are dying of cancer, and not signed up for cryonics, and
it's too late for them to get life insurance.

See, knowing about many worlds can help you visualize probabilities
as frequencies, because they usually *are.*

It might encourage you to get around to getting health insurance,
too, or wearing a helmet on your motorcycle, or whatever: don't
think you've gotten away with it so far.

And if you're planning to
[play the lottery](/lw/hl/lotteries_a_waste_of_hope/), don't think
you *might* win this time.  A vanishingly small fraction of you
wins, every time.  So either
[learn to discount small fractions of the future](/lw/my/the_allais_paradox/)
by
[shutting up and multiplying](/lw/n9/the_intuitions_behind_utilitarianism/),
or spend all your money on lottery tickets - your call.

It is a very important lesson in rationality, that at any time, the
Environment may suddenly ask you almost any question, which
requires you to draw on 7 different fields of knowledge.  If you
missed studying a single one of them, you may suffer arbitrarily
large penalties up to and including capital punishment.  You can
die for an answer you gave in 10 seconds, without realizing that a
field of knowledge existed of which you were ignorant.

This is why there is a
[virtue of scholarship](http://yudkowsky.net/virtues/).

[150,000](/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/) people die every day.  Some
of those deaths are truly unavoidable, but most are the result of
inadequate knowledge of cognitive biases, advanced futurism, and
quantum mechanics.(\*\*)

If you disagree with my premises or my conclusion, take a moment to
consider nonetheless, that
*the very existence of an argument about life-or-death stakes*,
whatever position you take in that argument, constitutes a
sufficient lesson on *the sudden relevance of scholarship.*


* * * * *

(\*)  The way cryonics works is that you get a life insurance
policy, and the policy pays for your cryonic suspension.  The
Cryonics Institute is the cheapest provider, Alcor is the
high-class one.  [Rudi Hoffman](mailto:rudihoffman@aol.com) set up
my own insurance policy, with CI.  I have no affiliate agreements
with any of these entities, nor, to my knowledge, do they have
affiliate agreements with anyone.  They're trying to look
respectable, and so they rely on altruism and word-of-mouth to
grow, instead of paid salespeople.  So there's a vastly smaller
worldwide market for immortality than lung-cancer-in-a-stick. 
Welcome to your Earth; it's going to stay this way until you fix
it.

(\*\*)  *Most* deaths?  Yes:  If cryonics were widely seen in the
same terms as any other medical procedure, economies of scale would
considerably diminish the cost; it would be applied routinely in
hospitals; and foreign aid would enable it to be applied even in
poor countries.  So children in Africa are dying because citizens
and politicians and philanthropists in the First World don't have a
gut-level understanding of quantum mechanics.
