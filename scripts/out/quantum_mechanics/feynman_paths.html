<p>At this point I would like to introduce another key idea in quantum mechanics.&#xA0; Unfortunately, this idea was introduced so well in chapter 2 of <em>QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</em> by Richard Feynman, that my mind goes blank when trying to imagine how to introduce it any other way.&#xA0; As a compromise with just stealing his entire book, I stole one diagram - a diagram of how a mirror <em>really </em>works.</p><a id="more"></a><p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/16/feynman1.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/04/16/feynman1.png" title="Feynman1" height="572" width="500" alt="Feynman1" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>In elementary school, you learn that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.&#xA0; But <em>actually</em>, saith Feynman, each part of the mirror reflects at all angles.</p>
<p>So why is it that, way up at the human level, the mirror seems to reflect with the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection?</p>
<p>Because in quantum mechanics, amplitude that flows to identical configurations (particles of the same species in the same places) is added together, regardless of how the amplitude got there.</p>
<p>To find the amplitude for a photon to go from S to P, you've got to add up the amplitudes for <em>all</em> the different ways the photon could get there - by bouncing off the mirror at A, bouncing off the mirror at B...</p>
<p>The rule of the Feynman "path integral" is that each of the paths from S to P contributes an amplitude of <em>constant</em> magnitude but varying <em>phase</em>, and the phase varies with the total <em>time</em> along the path.&#xA0; It's as if the photon is a tiny spinning clock - the hand of the clock stays the same length, but it turns around at a constant rate for each unit of time.</p>
<p>Feynman graphs the time for the photon to go from S to P via A, B, C, ...&#xA0; Observe: the <em>total</em> time <em>changes less</em> between "the path via F" and "the path via G", then the total time changes between "the path via A" and "the path via B".&#xA0; So the phase of the complex amplitude changes less, too.</p>
<p>And when you add up all the ways the photon can go from S to P, you find that most of the amplitude comes from the middle part of the mirror - the contributions from other parts of the mirror tend to mostly cancel each other out, as shown at the bottom of Feynman's figure.</p>
<p>There is no answer to the question "Which part of the mirror did the photon <em>really</em> come from?"&#xA0; Amplitude is flowing from <em>all </em>of these configurations.&#xA0; But if we were to <em>ignore</em> all the parts of the mirror except the middle, we would calculate essentially the same amount of <em>total</em> amplitude.</p>
<p>This means that a photon, which can get from S to P by striking <em>any </em>part of the mirror, will <em>behave pretty much as if</em> only a tiny part of the mirror exists - the part where the photon's angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.</p>
<p><em>Unless</em> you start playing clever tricks using your knowledge of quantum physics.</p>
<p>For example, you can <em>scrape away</em> parts of the mirror at regular intervals, deleting some little arrows and leaving others.&#xA0; Keep A and its little arrow; scrape away B so that it has no little arrow (at least no little arrow going to P).&#xA0; Then a distant part of the mirror can contribute amplitudes that add up with each other to a big final amplitude, because you've removed the amplitudes that were out of phase.</p>
<p>In which case you can make a mirror that reflects with the angle of incidence not equal to the angle of reflection.&#xA0; It's called a diffraction grating.&#xA0; But it reflects different wavelengths of light at different angles, so a diffraction grating is not quite a "mirror" in the sense you might imagine; it produces little rainbows of color, like a droplet of oil on the surface of water.</p>
<p>How fast does the little arrow rotate?&#xA0; As fast as the photon's wavelength - that's what a photon's wavelength <em>is</em>.&#xA0; The wavelength of yellow light is ~570 nanometers:&#xA0; If yellow light travels an extra 570 nanometers, its little arrow will turn all the way around and end up back where it started.</p>
<p>So either Feynman's picture is of a very tiny mirror, or he is talking about some very big photons, when you look at how fast the little arrows seem to be rotating.&#xA0; Relative to the wavelength of visible light, a human being is a lot bigger than the level at which you can see quantum effects.</p>
<p>You'll <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/quantum-arena.html">recall</a> that the first key to recovering the classical hallucination from the reality of quantum physics, was the possibility of approximate independence in the amplitude distribution.&#xA0; (Where the distribution roughly factorizes, it can look like a subsystem of particles is evolving on its own, without being entangled with every other particle
in the universe.)</p>
<p>The second key to re-deriving the classical hallucination, is the kind of behavior that we see in this mirror.&#xA0; Most of the possible paths cancel each other out, and only a small group of neighboring paths add up.&#xA0; Most of the amplitude comes from a small neighborhood of histories - the sort of history where, for example, the photon's angle of incidence is equal to its angle of reflection.&#xA0; And so too with many other things you are pleased to regard as "normal".
</p>
<p>My first posts on QM showed amplitude
flowing in crude chunks from discrete situation to discrete situation.&#xA0; In <em>real life</em> there are continuous amplitude
flows between continuous configurations, like we saw with Feynman's mirror.&#xA0; But by the time you climb all the way up from a few hundred nanometers to the size scale of human beings, most of the amplitude contributions have canceled out except for a narrow neighborhood around one path through history.</p>
<p>Mind you, this is <em>not</em> the reason why a photon only seems to be in one place at a time.&#xA0; That's a different story, which we won't get to today.</p>
<p>

The more massive things are - actually the more energetic they are,
mass being a form of energy - the faster the little arrows rotate. Shorter wavelengths of light having more energy is a special case of
this.&#xA0; Compound objects, like a neutron made of three quarks, can be treated as having a collective amplitude that is the multiplicative product of the component amplitudes - at least to the extent that the amplitude distribution factorizes, so that you can treat the neutron as an individual.</p>
<p>Thus the relation between energy and wavelength holds for more than photons and electrons; atoms, molecules, and human beings can be regarded as having a wavelength.</p>
<p>But by the time you move up to a human being - or even a single biological cell - the mass-energy is <em>really, really</em> large relative to a yellow photon.&#xA0; So the clock is rotating <em>really, really fast.</em>&#xA0; The wavelength is <em>really, really</em> short.&#xA0; Which means that the neighborhood of paths where things don't cancel out is <em>really, really narrow.</em></p>
<p>By and large, a human experiences what seems like a single path through configuration space - the classical hallucination.</p>
<p>This is not how Schr&#xE23;&#xE16;dinger's Cat works, but it is how a regular cat works.</p>
<p>Just remember that this business of single paths through time is not <em>fundamentally</em> true.&#xA0; It's merely a good approximation for modeling a sofa.&#xA0; The classical hallucination breaks down completely by the time you get to the atomic level.&#xA0; It can't handle quantum computers at all.&#xA0; It would fail you even if you wanted a <em>sufficiently precise</em> prediction of a brick.&#xA0; A billiard ball taking a single path through time is not how the universe <em>really, really</em> works - it is just what human beings have evolved to easily visualize, for the sake of throwing rocks.</p>
<p>(PS:&#xA0; I'm given to understand that the Feynman path integral may be more
fundamental than the Schr&#xE23;&#xE16;dinger equation: that is, you can <em>derive</em>
Schr&#xE23;&#xE16;dinger from Feynman.&#xA0; But as far as I can tell from examining the
equations, Feynman is still differentiating the amplitude distribution,
and so reality doesn't yet break down into point amplitude flows
between point configurations.&#xA0; Some physicist please<em>&#xA0;</em>correct me if I'm wrong about this, because it is a matter on which I am quite curious.)</p>
