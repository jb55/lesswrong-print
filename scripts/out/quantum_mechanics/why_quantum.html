<p>"Why are you doing these posts on quantum physics?" the one asked me.</p>
<p>"Quite a number of reasons," I said.</p>
<p>"For one thing," I said, "the many-worlds issue is just about the only case I know of where you can bring the principles of Science and Bayesianism into <em>direct</em> <a href="/lw/qa/the_dilemma_science_or_bayes/">conflict</a>."&#xA0; It's important to have <a href="/lw/nw/fallacies_of_compression/">different mental buckets</a> for "science" and "rationality", as they are <a href="/lw/in/scientific_evidence_legal_evidence_rational/">different concepts</a>.&#xA0; Bringing the two principles into direct conflict is helpful for illustrating what science <a href="/lw/qb/science_doesnt_trust_your_rationality/">is</a> and is not, and what rationality <a href="/lw/nc/newcombs_problem_and_regret_of_rationality/">is</a> and is not.&#xA0; Otherwise you end up trusting in what you call "science", which won't be <a href="/lw/qd/science_isnt_strict_enough/">strict enough</a>.</p>
<p>"For another thing," I continued, "part of what goes into becoming a rationalist, is learning to live into a counterintuitive world - learning to find things underneath the surface that are unlike the world of surface forms."&#xA0; Quantum mechanics makes a good introduction to that, when done correctly <a href="/lw/pc/quantum_explanations/">without the horrible confusion and despair</a>.&#xA0; It breaks you of your belief in an <em>intuitive </em>universe, counters naive realism, destroys your trust in the way that your <a href="/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/">cognitive algorithms look from inside</a> - and then you're ready to start seeing your mind <em>as a mind,</em> not as a window onto reality.</p><a id="more"></a><p>"But you're writing about physics, without being a physicist," the one said, "isn't that... a little..."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "it is, and I felt guilty about it.&#xA0; But there were physicists <a href="/lw/q3/decoherence_is_simple/">talking complete nonsense about Occam's Razor</a> without knowing the probability theory of it, so my hand was forced.&#xA0; Also the situation in teaching quantum mechanics is <a href="/lw/pc/quantum_explanations/">really awful</a> - I saw the introductions to Bayesianism and they seemed unnecessarily difficult, but the situation in quantum mechanics is <em>so</em> much worse."&#xA0; It really is.&#xA0; I remember sitting there staring at the "linear operators", trying to figure out what the hell they physically <em>did</em> to the eigenvectors -&#xA0; trying to visualize the actual <em>events </em>that
were going on in the physical evolution - before it dawned on me that
it was just a math trick to extract the average of the eigenvalues. 
Okay, but... can't you just <em>tell</em> me that up front?&#xA0; Write it <em>down</em> somewhere?&#xA0; Oh, I forgot, the math <em>doesn't mean anything, it just works.</em></p>
<p>"<em>Furthermore,</em>" I added, "knowing about many worlds, helps you visualize probabilities as frequencies, which is helpful to many points I want to make."</p>
<p>"And <em>furthermore,</em>" I said, "reducing time to non-time is a powerful example of the principle, in reductionism, that you should reduce something to something other than itself."</p>
<p>"And even <em>furthermore,</em>" I said, "I had to break my readers of trust in Science, even trust in physicists, because <a href="/lw/qf/no_safe_defense_not_even_science/">it doesn't seem possible to think and trust</a> at the same time."</p>
<p>"Many-worlds is really a very clear and simple problem," I said, "by comparison with the challenges you encounter in AI, which are around a hundred times less clear-cut.&#xA0; And many scientists can't even get many-worlds, in the absence of authority."&#xA0; So you are left with no choice but to aspire to do better than the average scientist; a hell of a lot better, in fact.&#xA0; This notion is one that you cannot just blurt out to people without showing them why it is necessary.</p>
<p>Another helpful advantage - I often do things with quite a few different purposes in mind, as you may have realized by this point - was that you can see various commenters who still haven't gotten it, who are still saying, "Oh, look, Eliezer is overconfident because he believes in many-worlds."</p>
<p>Well, if you can viscerally see the arguments I have laid forth, then you can see that I am not being careless in having an opinion about physics.&#xA0; The balance of arguments is overwhelmingly tipped; and physicists who deny it, are making specific errors of probability theory (which I have specifically laid out, and shown to you) that they might not be expected to know about.&#xA0; It is not just a matter of my forming strong opinions at random.</p>
<p>But would you believe that I had such strong support, if I had not shown it to you in full detail?&#xA0; Ponder this well.&#xA0; For I may have other strong opinions.&#xA0; And it may seem to you that <em>you</em> don't <a href="/lw/kj/no_one_knows_what_science_doesnt_know/">see</a> any good reason to form such strong beliefs.&#xA0; Except this is <em>not </em>what you will see; you will see simply that there <em>is</em> no good reason for strong belief, that there <em>is</em> no strong support one way or the other.&#xA0; For our first-order beliefs are how the world seems to <em>be.</em>&#xA0; And you may think, "Oh, Eliezer is just opinionated - forming strong beliefs in the absence of lopsided support."&#xA0; And I will not have the time to do another couple of months worth of blog posts.</p>
<p>I am <em>very</em> far from infallible, but I do not hold strong opinions at random.</p>
<p>"And <em>yet still furthermore,</em>" I said, "transhumanist mailing lists have been arguing about issues of personal identity for years, and a tremendous amount of time has been wasted on it."&#xA0; Probably most who argue, will not bother to read what I have set forth; but if it stops any intelligent folk from wasting further time, that too is a benefit.</p>
<p>I am sometimes accused of being overconfident and opinionated, for telling people that being composed of "the same atoms" has nothing to do with their personal continuity.&#xA0; Or for saying that an uploading scan performed to the same resolution as thermal noise, actually has less effect on your identity than a sneeze (because your eyes squeeze shut when you sneeze, and that actually <em>alters</em> the computational state of billions of neurons in your visual cortex).&#xA0; Yet if you can see your <em>nows</em> braided into causality of the river that never flows; and the synaptic connections computing your internal narrative, that remain the same from one time to another, though not a drop of water is shared; then you can see that I have reasons for this strong belief as well.</p>
<p dragover="true">Perhaps the one says to me that the exact duplicate constructed on Mars, is <em>just a copy.</em>&#xA0; And I post a short comment saying, "Wrong.&#xA0; There is no copy, there are two originals.&#xA0; This is knowable and I know it."&#xA0; Would you have thought that I might have very strong support, that you might not be seeing?</p>
<p dragover="true">



I won't always have the time to write a month of blog posts. 
While I am enough of a Traditional Rationalist that I dislike trust,
and will not lightly ask it, I may ask it of you <a href="/lw/qx/timeless_identity/">if your life is at stake</a>.</p>
<p>Another one once asked me:&#xA0; "What does quantum physics have to do with overcoming bias?"</p>
<p>Robin Hanson chose the name "Overcoming Bias"; but names are not steel chains.&#xA0; If I'd started my own personal blog for the material I'm now posting, I would have called it "Reinventing Rationality" or something along those lines - and even that wouldn't have been the <em>real</em> purpose, which would have been harder to explain.</p>
<p>What are these series of posts, <em>really?</em>&#xA0; Raw material for a popular <a href="/lw/jf/why_im_blooking/">book on rationality</a> - but maybe a tenth of this material, or less, will make it into the book.&#xA0; One of the reasons I write long posts, is so that I can shorten them later with a good conscience, knowing that I did lay out the full argument <em>somewhere.</em>&#xA0; But the whole quantum physics sequence is probably not going to make it into the popular book at all - and neither will many other posts.&#xA0; So what's the <em>rest</em> of it for?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think wistfully of how much more I could have accomplished in my teenage years, if I had known a fraction of what I know now at age 15.&#xA0; (This is the age at which I was a Traditional Rationalist, and dedicated and bright as such ones go, but knew not the Way of Bayes.)&#xA0; You can think of these blog posts, perhaps, as a series of letters to my past self.&#xA0; Only not exactly, because some of what I now write, I <em>did</em> already know then.</p>
<p>It seems to me, looking back, that the road which took me to this Way, had a great deal of luck in it.&#xA0; I would like to eliminate that element of luck for those who come after.&#xA0; So some of what I post, is more formal explanations of matters which Eliezer-15 knew in his bones.&#xA0; And the rest, I only <em>wish</em> I had known. </p>
<p>Perhaps if you prime someone with enough material as a starting point, they can figure out the other 95% on their own, if they go on to study the relevant sciences at a higher technical level.&#xA0; That's what I hope.</p>
<p>Eliezer-15 was led far astray by the seeming mysteriousness of quantum mechanics.&#xA0; An antiproject in which he was aided and abetted by certain popular physicists - notably Sir Roger Penrose; but also all those physicists who told him that quantum physics was "mysterious" and that it was okay not to understand it.</p>
<p dragover="true">This is something I wish I had known, so I explained it to me.</p>
<p dragover="true">Why not just tell me to ignore quantum physics?&#xA0; Because I am not going to "just ignore" a question that large.&#xA0; It is not how we work.</p>
<p>If you are confronting real scientific chaos - not just some light matter of an experimental anomaly or the search for a better theory, but genuine fear and despair, as now exists in Artificial Intelligence - then it is necessary to be a polymath.&#xA0; Healthy fields have healthy ways of thinking; you cannot trust the traditions of the confused field you must reform, though you must learn them.&#xA0; You never know which way you'll need to draw upon, on venturing out into the unknown.&#xA0; You learn new sciences for the same reasons that programmers learn new programming languages: to change the way you think.&#xA0; If you want to never learn anything without knowing in advance how it will apply, you had best stay away from chaos.</p>
<p>If you want to tackle challenges on the order of AI, you can't just learn a bunch of AI stuff.</p>
<p>And finally...</p>
<p>Finally...</p>
<p>There finally comes a point where you get tired of trying to communicate across <a href="/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/">vast inferential distances</a>.&#xA0; There comes a point where you get tired of not being able to say things to people without a month of preliminary explanation.&#xA0; There comes a point where you want to say something about branching Earths or identical particles or braids in the river that never flows, and you can't.</p>
<p>It is such a tremendous relief, to finally be able to say all these things.&#xA0; And all the other things, that I have said here; that people have asked me about for so long, and all I could do was wave my hands.&#xA0; I didn't have to explain the concept of "inferential distance" from scratch, I could just link to it.&#xA0; It is such a relief.</p>
<p>I have written hundreds of blog posts here.&#xA0; Think about what it would be like, to carry all that around<em> inside your head.</em></p>
<p>If I can do all the <em>long</em> sequences on Overcoming Bias, then maybe after that, it will be possible to say most things that I want to say, in just one piece.</p></div></div></div>
