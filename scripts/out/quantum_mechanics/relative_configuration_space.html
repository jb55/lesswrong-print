as standard physics.</strong></p>
<p>Today's post draws on the work of the physicist <a href="http://www.platonia.com/papers.html">Julian Barbour</a>, and contains diagrams stolen and/or modified from his book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0753810204/platonia">The End of Time</a>".</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="/lw/qm/machs_principle_antiepiphenomenal_physics/">Previously</a>, we saw Mach's idea (following in the earlier path of Leibniz) that inertia is resistance to <em>relative</em> motion.&#xA0; So that, if the whole universe was rotating, it would drag the inertial frame along with it.&#xA0; From the perspective of General Relativity, the rotating matter would generate gravitational waves.</p>
<p>All right:&#xA0; It's possible that you can't tell if the universe is rotating, because the laws of gravitation may be set up to make it look the same either way.&#xA0; But even if this turns out to be the case, it may not yet seem <em>impossible to imagine</em> that things could have been otherwise.</p>
<p dragover="true">To expose Mach's Principle <em>directly,</em> we turn to Julian Barbour.</p>
<p dragover="true">The diagrams that follow are stolen from Julian Barbour's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Time-Next-Revolution-Physics/dp/0195117298">The End of Time</a>.&#xA0; I'd forgotten what an amazing book this was, or I would have stolen diagrams from it earlier to explain <a dragover="true" href="/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/">configuration space</a>. 
Anyone interested in the nature of reality must read this book.&#xA0; Anyone
interested in understanding modern quantum mechanics should read this
book.&#xA0; "Must" and "should" are defined as in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.</p><a id="more"></a><p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourconfigurationcube_2.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourconfigurationcube_2.png" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" title="Jbarbourconfigurationcube_2" height="313" width="333" alt="Jbarbourconfigurationcube_2" border="0"></a>Suppose that we have three particles, A, B, and C, on a 2-dimensional plane; and suppose that these are the <em>only</em> 3 particles in the universe.</p>
<p>Let there be a<a href="/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/"> classical configuration space</a> which describes the 2D positions of A, B, and C.&#xA0; 3 classical 2D particles require a 6-dimensional configuration space.</p>
<p>If your monitor cannot display 6-dimensional space, I've set a 2D projection of a 3D cube to appear instead.&#xA0; If you see what looks like a window into an incomprehensible void, try using Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The thing about this 6-dimensional cube, is that it contains <em>too much information</em>.&#xA0; By looking at an exact point in this cube - supposedly corresponding to an exact state of reality - we can read off information that A, B, and C will never be able to observe.</p>
<p>The point (0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5) corresponds to A at (0, 1), B at (3, 4), and C at (2, 5).&#xA0; Now consider the point (1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 5); which corresponds to moving A, B, and C one unit to the right, in unison.</p>
<p>Can A, B, and C ever detect any experimental difference?&#xA0; Supposing that A, B, and C can <em>only</em> see <em>each other,</em> as opposed to seeing "absolute space" in the background?</p>
<p>After we shift the universe to the right (shift the origin to the left), A looks around... and sees B and C at the same distance from itself as before.&#xA0; B and C can't detect any difference in the universe either.</p>
<p>Yet we have described (0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5) and (1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 5) as two different points in the configuration space.&#xA0; Even though, to A, B, and C, the associated states of reality seem indistinguishable.&#xA0; We have postulated an epiphenomenal difference:&#xA0; This suggests that our physics is not over the true elements of reality.&#xA0; (Remember, this has been, historically, a highly productive line of reasoning!&#xA0; It is not just logic-chopping.)</p>
<p>Indeed, our classical configuration space has <em>many</em> epiphenomenal differences.&#xA0; We can rotate the three particles in unison, and end up with a different point in the configuration space; while A, B, and C again see themselves at the same distances from each other.&#xA0; The "rotation" that took place, was a matter of <em>us</em> looking at them from a different angle, from <em>outside their universe</em>.&#xA0; Which is to say the "rotation" was a choice of viewpoint for <em>us</em>, not an experimentally detectable fact <em>within</em> the ABC universe.</p>
<p>How can we rid the physics of mind projections and epiphenomena?</p>
<p>A and B and C cannot observe their absolute positions in space against a fixed background.&#xA0; Treating these absolute positions as elements of reality may be part of our problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourrelative.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourrelative.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title="Jbarbourrelative" height="218" width="226" alt="Jbarbourrelative" border="0"></a>
What <em>can</em> A, B, and C observe?&#xA0; By hypothesis, they can observe their distances from each other.&#xA0; They can measure the distances AB, BC, and CA.</p>
<p>Why not use <em>that</em> as the dimensions of a configuration space?</p>
<p>At right is depicted a <em>relative configuration space</em> whose three dimensions are the distances AB, BC, and CA.&#xA0; It really is 3-dimensional, now!</p>
<p>If you're wondering why the configuration space looks pyramidal, it's because any point with e.g. AB + BC &lt; CA is "outside the configuration space".&#xA0; It does not represent a realizable triangle, because one side is longer than the sum of the other two.&#xA0; Likewise AB + CA &lt; BC and BC + CA &lt; AB.</p>
<p>Every different point in this configuration space, corresponds to an <em>experimentally different</em> state of reality that A, B, and C can observe.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourtriangleland1_2.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourtriangleland1_2.png" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" title="Jbarbourtriangleland1_2" height="334" width="334" alt="Jbarbourtriangleland1_2" border="0"></a>(Albeit this assumes that ABC can measure absolute, rather than relative, distances.&#xA0; Otherwise, different slices of pyramid-space would be observationally identical because they would describe the same triangle at different scales, as shown at left.)</p>
<p>(Oh, and we're assuming that A, B, and C can tell each other apart - perhaps they are different colors.)</p>
<p>The edges of each slice of the configuration space, are the configurations with A, B, and C on the same line.&#xA0; E.g., if AB + BC = CA, then B lies on a point between A and C.</p>
<p>The corners of each slice are the configurations in which two points coincide; e.g., AB=0, BC=CA.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtriangleland2.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtriangleland2.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title="Jbarbourtriangleland2" height="292" width="402" alt="Jbarbourtriangleland2" border="0"></a>
At right (or possibly below, depending on your screen width), is a diagram showing a single slice in greater detail; Julian Barbour credits this to his friend Dierck Liebscher.</p>
<p>The point in the center of the slice corresponds to an equilateral triangle.</p>
<p>The dashed lines, which are axes of bilateral symmetry of the configuration space, contain points that correspond to isosceles triangles.</p>
<p>The curved lines are right-angled triangles.</p>
<p>Points "inside" the curved lines are acute triangles; points "outside" the curved lines are obtuse triangles.</p>
<p>What about <em>three</em> points coinciding?</p>
<p>There is no triangle <em>at this scale</em> where all three points coincide.</p>
<p>Remember, this is just one <em>slice </em>of the configuration space.&#xA0; Every point in the <em>whole</em> configuration space corresponds to what ABC experience as a different state of affairs.</p>
<p>The configuration where A, B, and C are all in the same place is <em>unique</em> in their experience.&#xA0; So it is only found in <em>one</em> slice of the configuration space:&#xA0; The slice that is a single point, at the tip of the infinite pyramid:&#xA0; The degenerate slice where the center and the corners are the same point:&#xA0; The slice that is the single point in configuration space:&#xA0; AB=BC=CA=0.</p>
<p>Julian Barbour calls this point Alpha.</p>
<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself, here - that sort of thing is the topic of tomorrow's post.</p>
<p>To see the power of a relative configuration space, observe how it makes it impossible to <em>imagine </em>certain epiphenomenal differences:</p>
<p>Put your Newtonian goggles back on: imagine A, B, and C as little
billiard balls bouncing around in plain old space (not configuration
space) and time.&#xA0; Perhaps A, B, and C attract each other via a kind of gravity, and so orbit around one another.&#xA0; If you were looking at the evolution of A, B, and C in plain old space and time, then a strobe-lit photograph of their motion might look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourtriangleseries.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourtriangleseries.png" title="Jbarbourtriangleseries" height="331" width="347" alt="Jbarbourtriangleseries" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>In this time-series photograph, we've seen points A, B, and C forming a triangle.&#xA0; Not only do the points of the triangle orbit around each other, but they also seem to be heading down and to the right.&#xA0; It seems like you can imagine the triangle heading off up and to the right, or up and to the left, or perhaps spinning around much faster.&#xA0; Even though A, B, and C, who can only see their distance to each other, would never notice the difference.</p>
<p>Now we could also map that whole trajectory over time, onto the relative configuration space.&#xA0; If AB+BC+CA happens to be a constant throughout the evolution, then we could conveniently map the trajectory onto one slice of configuration space:</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourshapepath.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourshapepath.png" title="Jbarbourshapepath" height="240" width="336" alt="Jbarbourshapepath" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>(This doesn't actually represent the triangle-series shown above it, but imagine that it does.)</p>
<p>If this is what you believe to be the <em>reality</em> - this trajectory in the relative configuration space - then, if I ask you to imagine, "Suppose that the triangle is heading up and to the left, instead of down and to the right", I have just uttered <em>physical nonsense.</em>&#xA0; Mapping that alternative trajectory in Newtonian space, onto the relative configuration space, would produce just the same curve.&#xA0; And if the laws of physics are over the relative configuration space, then this curve is all there <em>is.</em></p>
<p>Imagine physics over trajectories in a relative configuration space like this one, but with many more particles, and perhaps 3 space dimensions.&#xA0; Sentient beings evolve in this universe, on some equivalent of a planet.&#xA0; They hunt across fields that do not seem to shift underfoot.&#xA0; They have a strong illusion of moving through an absolute space, against an absolute background; the relativity of motion is hidden from them.</p>
<p>But if the fundamental laws of their universe were over relative configurations, then it would not just be a <em>contingent</em> fact about their universe, that if all the particles were speeding or accelerating or rotating in unison, all the experiments would come out the same.&#xA0; Talking about "all the particles rotating in unison" would be <em>physical nonsense</em>.&#xA0; It only makes physical sense to talk about the velocity of <em>some </em>particles relative to <em>other</em> particles.</p>
<p dragover="true">Your ancestors evolved on a savanna that seemed to stay put while they ran across it.&#xA0; You can, by an effort of mind, visualize a car that stays motionless as the world zips past, or alternatively, visualize a world that remains motionless as the car zips past.&#xA0; You can, by an effort of mind, see that the internal relations are the same.&#xA0; But it still seems to you that you are imagining two different things.</p>
<p dragover="true">Your visual neurology is representing objects in terms of absolute positions against a fixed background.&#xA0; There is a web of cortical columns in your visual cortex that activate to create a mental picture.&#xA0; The particular columns that activate, are felt by you as positions in your visual field.&#xA0; That is <a href="/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/">how the algorithm feels from inside</a>.</p>
<p>In a universe whose physics is over a relative configuration space, the absolute positions, and the fixed background, are not elements of reality.&#xA0; They are <a href="/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/">mind projection fallacies</a>, the shadows of a point of view; as if your mind's eye were outside the universe, and the universe could move relative to that.</p>
<p>But if you could learn to visualize the relative configuration space, then, so long as you thought in terms of those elements of reality, it would no longer be <em>imaginable</em> that Mach's Principle could be false.</p>
<p>I am not entirely convinced of this notion of a relative configuration space.&#xA0; My soul as a computer programmer cries out against the idea of representing N particles with N<sup>2</sup> distances between them; it seems wasteful.&#xA0; On the other hand, I have no evidence that the Tao is prejudiced against <em>redundant</em> or <em>overconstrained</em> representations, in the same way that the Tao seems prejudiced against <em>epiphenomena</em> in representations.&#xA0; Though my soul as a programmer cries out against it, better an overconstrained representation than an epiphenomenal one.&#xA0; Still, it does not feel entirely satisfactory, to me.&#xA0; It seems like merely the <em>best </em>representation, not the <em>true </em>one.</p>
<p>Also, any <a href="/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/">position basis invokes an arbitrary space of simultaneity</a>,
and a relative position basis does so as well.&#xA0; As required by Special Relativity, the choice makes no difference - but this means that the relative position basis <em>still</em> contains epiphenomenal information.&#xA0; Perhaps the true representation will be more strictly local, in terms of invariant states of distant entanglement, as I've <a href="/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/">suggested before</a>; and maybe, who knows, it won't be overconstrained?</p>
<p>Relativizing the position basis feels to me like an <em>improvement,</em> but it doesn't seem <em>finished.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Of course, all this that we have said about the particles A, B, C and their trajectory through time, cannot <em>possibly </em>apply to our own universe.</p>
<p>In our <em>own </em>universe, as you may recall, there are no little billiard balls bouncing around.</p>
<p>In our own universe, if physics took place in a relative configuration space, it would be <em>quantum</em> physics in a relative configuration space.&#xA0; And a single moment of time, might look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtrianglecloud.png"><img src="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtrianglecloud.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title="Jbarbourtrianglecloud" height="233" width="267" alt="Jbarbourtrianglecloud" border="0"></a> At right we see a cloud of red and blue mist, representing a complex amplitude distribution over the relative configuration space.&#xA0; You could imagine that redness is the real part and blueness is the imaginary part, or some such.&#xA0; But this is not a realistic amplitude distribution - just a representation of the general idea, "A cloud of complex amplitude in configuration space."</p>
<p>As for why only a sixth of the triangle is colored:&#xA0; If A, B, and C are the same species of particle, which is to say, <a href="/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/">identical particles</a>, then the configuration space collapses along the sixfold symmetry corresponding to the six possible permutations of A, B, and C.</p>
<p>The whole cloud is a single static instant, in some arbitrary space of simultaneity.&#xA0; The quantum wavefunction is a distribution over configuration space, not a single point in configuration space.&#xA0; So to represent the state of the universe at a single moment, we need the whole cloud, which covers the entire collapsed configuration space.</p>
<p>You might naturally tend to assume that we could represent <em>time </em>using an animated version of this same diagram: and that the animated diagram would show the mist churning in the configuration space, the cloud's parts changing color, as amplitude flowed from volume to volume; and that as the quantum waves propagated, little blobs of amplitude density would move around through the configuration space, in trajectories much resembling the classical curve we saw earlier.</p>
<p>But that<em>&#xA0;</em>would be overcomplicating things.</p>
<p>Be aware:&#xA0; Churning mist in a non-relative configuration space, would be the metaphor that corresponds to the <em>standard</em> formulation of physics.&#xA0; That is, according to <em>standard</em> physics, the description I just gave above, would be correct (after we took it back out of the relative configuration space, which is <em>not</em> standard).</p>
<p>Yet tomorrow we shall discuss a certain <em>further</em> simplification of physics, which renders unimaginable still <em>another</em> epiphenomenal distinction, and deletes a <em>further </em>needless element of the laws.</p></div></div></div>
