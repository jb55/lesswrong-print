<p>In classical logic, the operational definition of identity is that
whenever 'A=B' is a theorem, you can substitute 'A' for 'B' in any
theorem where B appears.&#xA0; For example, if <tt>(2 + 2) = 4</tt> is a theorem, and <tt>((2 + 2) + 3) = 7</tt> is a theorem, then <tt>(4 + 3) = 7</tt> is a theorem.</p>
<p>This leads to a problem which is usually phrased in the following
terms:&#xA0; The morning star and the evening star happen to be the same
object, the planet Venus.&#xA0; Suppose John knows that the morning star and
evening star are the same object.&#xA0; Mary, however, believes that the
morning star is the god Lucifer, but the evening star is the god
Venus.&#xA0; John believes Mary believes that the morning star is Lucifer. 
Must John therefore (by substitution) believe that Mary believes that
the evening star is Lucifer?</p>
<p>Or here's an even simpler version of the problem.&#xA0; 2 + 2 = 4 is true; it is a theorem that <tt>(((2 + 2) = 4) = TRUE)</tt>.&#xA0; Fermat's Last Theorem is also true.&#xA0; So:&#xA0; I believe 2 + 2 = 4 =&gt; I believe TRUE =&gt; I believe Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>
<p>Yes, I know this seems <em>obviously</em> wrong.&#xA0; But imagine someone
writing a logical reasoning program using the principle "equal terms
can always be substituted", and this happening to them.&#xA0; Now imagine
them writing a paper about how to prevent it from happening.&#xA0; Now
imagine someone else disagreeing with their solution.&#xA0; The argument is
still going on.</p>
<p>P'rsnally, I would say that John is committing a type error, like
trying to subtract 5 grams from 20 meters.&#xA0; "The morning star" is not
the same <em>type</em> as the morning star, let alone the same thing.&#xA0; Beliefs are not planets.</p>
<a id="more"></a><blockquote><p>morning star = evening star<br>"morning star" &#x2260; "evening star"</p></blockquote><p>The
problem, in my view, stems from the failure to enforce the type
distinction between beliefs and things.&#xA0; The original error was writing
an AI that stores its beliefs about Mary's beliefs about "the morning
star" using the same representation as in its beliefs about the morning
star.</p>
<p>If Mary believes the "morning star" is Lucifer, that doesn't mean
Mary believes the "evening star" is Lucifer, because "morning star" &#x2260;
"evening star".&#xA0; The whole paradox stems from the failure to use quote
marks in appropriate places.</p>
<p>You may recall that this is not the first time I've talked about
enforcing type discipline - the last time was when I spoke about the
error of <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/terminal-values.html">confusing expected utilities with utilities</a>. 
It is immensely helpful, when one is first learning physics, to learn
to keep track of one's units - it may seem like a bother to keep
writing down 'cm' and 'kg' and so on, until you notice that (a) your
answer seems to be the wrong order of magnitude and (b) it is expressed
in seconds per square gram.</p>
<p>Similarly, beliefs are different things than planets.&#xA0; If we're
talking about human beliefs, at least, then:&#xA0; Beliefs live in brains,
planets live in space.&#xA0; Beliefs weigh a few micrograms, planets weigh a
lot more.&#xA0; Planets are larger than beliefs... but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Merely putting quote marks around "morning star" seems insufficient
to prevent people from confusing it with the morning star, due to the
visual similarity of the text.&#xA0; So perhaps a better way to enforce type
discipline would be with a visibly different encoding:</p><blockquote><p>morning star = evening star<br>13.15.18.14.9.14.7.0.19.20.1.18 &#x2260; 5.22.5.14.9.14.7.0.19.20.1.18</p></blockquote><p>Studying mathematical logic may also help you learn to distinguish the quote and the referent.&#xA0; In mathematical logic, <tt>|- P</tt> (P is a theorem) and <tt>|- []'P'</tt>
(it is provable that there exists an encoded proof of the encoded
sentence P in some encoded proof system) are very distinct
propositions.&#xA0; If you drop a level of quotation in mathematical logic,
it's like dropping a metric unit in physics - you can derive visibly
ridiculous results, like "The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters
long."</p>
<p>Alfred Tarski once tried to define the meaning of 'true' using
an infinite family of sentences:</p><blockquote><p>("Snow is white" is true) if and only (snow is white)<br>
("Weasels are green" is true) if and only if (weasels are green)<br>...</p></blockquote><p>When sentences like these start seeming meaningful, you'll know that you've started to distinguish between encoded sentences and states of the outside world.</p>
<p>Similarly, the notion of <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/truth.html">truth</a> is quite different from the notion of <em>reality.</em>&#xA0; Saying "true" <em>compares</em> a belief to reality.&#xA0; Reality itself does not need to be compared to any beliefs in order to be real.&#xA0; Remember this the next time someone claims that nothing is true.</p></div></div></div>
