  <div><p><strong>Followup to</strong>:&#xA0; <a href="/lw/ot/bind_yourself_to_reality/">Bind Yourself to Reality</a> </p>
<p>For many years before the Wright Brothers, people dreamed of flying with magic potions.&#xA0; There was <a href="/lw/ot/bind_yourself_to_reality/">nothing irrational</a> about the <em>raw desire</em> to fly.&#xA0; There was nothing <em>tainted</em> about the wish to look down on a cloud from above.&#xA0; Only the "magic potions" part was irrational.</p>
<p>Suppose you were to put me into an fMRI scanner, and take a movie of my
brain's activity levels, while I watched a space shuttle launch.&#xA0; (Wanting to visit space is not "realistic", but it is an essentially lawful dream - one that can be fulfilled in a lawful universe.)&#xA0; The fMRI might
- maybe, maybe not - resemble the fMRI of a devout Christian watching a nativity
scene.</p>
<p>Should an experimenter obtain this result, there's a lot of people
out there, both Christians and some atheists, who would gloat:&#xA0; "Ha, ha, space travel is your <a href="/lw/lo/uncritical_supercriticality/">religion</a>!"</p>
<p>But that's drawing the wrong <a href="/lw/o2/mutual_information_and_density_in_thingspace/">category</a> <a href="/lw/o3/superexponential_conceptspace_and_simple_words/">boundary</a>.&#xA0; It's like saying that, because some people once tried to fly by irrational
means, no one should ever enjoy looking out of an airplane window on
the clouds below.</p>
<a id="more"></a><p>If a rocket launch is what it takes to give me a feeling of aesthetic transcendence, I do not see this as a <em>substitute </em>for
religion.&#xA0; That is theomorphism - the viewpoint from gloating religionists who assume
that everyone who <em>isn't</em> religious has a hole in their mind that wants
filling.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair to the religionists, this is not <em>just </em>a gloating assumption.&#xA0; There <em>are</em> atheists who have religion-shaped holes in their minds.&#xA0; I <em>have </em>seen attempts to substitute atheism or even transhumanism for religion.&#xA0; And the result is invariably awful.&#xA0; Utterly awful.&#xA0; Absolutely abjectly awful.</p>
<p>I call such efforts, "hymns to the nonexistence of God".</p>
<p>When someone sets out to write an atheistic hymn - "Hail, oh unintelligent universe," blah, blah, blah - the result will, without exception, suck.</p>
<p>Why?&#xA0; Because they're being <a href="/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/">imitative.</a>&#xA0; Because they have no motivation for writing the hymn <em>except</em> a vague feeling that since churches have hymns, they ought to have one too.&#xA0; And, on a purely artistic level, that puts them far beneath genuine religious art that is not an imitation of anything, but an original expression of emotion.</p>
<p> Religious hymns were (often) written by people who <em>felt strongly</em> and<em> wrote honestly</em> and put serious effort into the prosody and imagery of their work - that's what gives their work the grace that it possesses, of artistic integrity.</p>
<p>So are atheists doomed to hymnlessness?</p>
<p>There is an acid test of attempts at post-theism.&#xA0; The acid test is:&#xA0; "If religion had never existed among the human species - if we had <em>never made</em> the original mistake - would this song, this art, this ritual, this way of thinking, still make sense?"</p>
<p>If humanity had never made the original mistake, there would be no hymns to the nonexistence of God.&#xA0; But there would still be marriages, so the notion of an atheistic marriage ceremony makes perfect sense - as long as you don't suddenly launch into a lecture on how God doesn't exist.&#xA0; Because, in a world where religion <em>never had</em> existed, nobody would interrupt a wedding to talk about the implausibility of a distant hypothetical concept.&#xA0; They'd talk about love, children, commitment, honesty, devotion, but who the heck would mention God?</p>
<p>And, in a human world where religion <em>never had</em> existed, there would still be people who got tears in their eyes watching a space shuttle launch.</p>
<p dragover="true">Which is why, even if experiment shows that watching a shuttle launch makes "religion"-associated areas of my brain light up,
associated with feelings of transcendence, I do not see that as a <em>substitute</em> for religion; I expect the same brain areas would light up, for the same reason, if I lived in a world
where religion had never been invented.
</p>
<p>A good "atheistic hymn" is simply a song about anything worth singing about that doesn't happen to be religious.</p>
<p dragover="true">Also, <a dragover="true" href="/lw/lw/reversed_stupidity_is_not_intelligence/">reversed stupidity is not intelligence</a>.&#xA0; The world's greatest idiot may say the Sun is shining, but that doesn't make it dark out.&#xA0; The point is <em>not</em> to create a life that resembles religion as little as possible in every surface aspect - this is the same kind of thinking that inspires hymns to the nonexistence of God.&#xA0; If humanity had never made the original mistake, no one would be <em>trying to avoid</em> things that vaguely resembled religion.&#xA0; Believe accurately, then <a href="/lw/hp/feeling_rational/">feel accordingly</a>:&#xA0; If space launches actually exist, and watching a rocket rise makes you want to sing, then write the song, dammit.</p><p>If I get tears in my eyes at a space shuttle
launch, it doesn't mean I'm trying to fill a hole left by religion - it means that my emotional energies, my <em>caring,</em> are <a href="/lw/ot/bind_yourself_to_reality/">bound into the real
world</a>.</p>
<p>If God did speak plainly, and answer prayers reliably, God would just
become one more boringly real thing, <a href="/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/">no more worth believing in than
the postman</a>.&#xA0; If God were real, it would destroy the inner uncertainty
that brings forth outward fervor in compensation.&#xA0; And if everyone
else believed God were real, it would destroy the specialness of being
one of the elect.</p>
<p>If you invest your emotional energy in space travel, you don't have those vulnerabilities.&#xA0; I can <em>see</em>
the Space Shuttle rise without losing the awe.&#xA0; Everyone else can
believe that Space Shuttles are real, and it doesn't make them any less
special.&#xA0; I haven't painted myself into the corner.</p>
<p>The choice between God and humanity is not just a choice of drugs.&#xA0; Above all, humanity <em>actually exists.</em><em>&#xA0;</em></p>
