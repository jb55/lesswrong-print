  <div><p><strong>Followup to</strong>:&#xA0; <a href="/lw/p2/hand_vs_fingers/">Hand vs. Fingers</a></p>
<p>Fundamental physics - quarks 'n stuff - is far removed from the levels we can <a href="/lw/p2/hand_vs_fingers/"><em>see,</em></a>
like hands and fingers.&#xA0; At best, you can know how to replicate the experiments which show that your hand (like everything else) is composed of quarks, and you may know how to derive a few equations for things like atoms and electron clouds and molecules.</p>
<p>At worst, the existence of quarks beneath your hand may just be something you were <a href="/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/">told</a>.&#xA0; In which case it's questionable in one what sense you can be said to "know" it at all, even if you repeat back the same word "quark" that a physicist would use to convey knowledge to another physicist.</p>
<p>Either way, you can't actually <em>see</em> the identity between levels - no one has a brain large enough to <em>visualize</em> avogadros of quarks and recognize a hand-pattern in them.</p>
<p>But we at least understand what hands <em>do.</em>&#xA0; Hands push on things, exert forces on them.&#xA0; When we're told about atoms, we visualize little billiard balls
bumping into each other.&#xA0; This makes it seem obvious that "atoms" can
push on things too, by bumping into them.</p>
<p>Now this notion of atoms is not quite correct.&#xA0; But so far as <em>human imagination</em>
goes, it's relatively easy to imagine our hand being made up of a
little galaxy of swirling billiard balls, pushing on things when our "fingers" touch them.&#xA0; Democritus imagined this
2400 years ago, and there was a time, roughly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">1803-1922</a>, when Science thought he was right.</p>
<p>But what about, say, anger?</p>
<p>How could little billiard balls be angry?&#xA0; Tiny frowny faces on the billiard balls?</p><a id="more"></a><p dragover="true">Put yourself in the shoes of, say, a hunter-gatherer
- someone who may not even have a notion of writing, let alone the
notion of using base matter to perform computations - someone who has
no idea that such a thing as neurons exist.&#xA0; Then you can imagine the <em>functional</em> gap that your ancestors might have perceived between billiard balls and "Grrr!&#xA0; Aaarg!"</p>
<p dragover="true">Forget about subjective experience for the moment, and consider the sheer <em>behavioral</em> gap between anger and billiard balls.&#xA0; The difference between what little billiard balls <em>do,</em> and what anger makes people <em>do.</em> 
Anger can make people raise their fists and hit someone - or say snide
things behind their backs - or plant scorpions in their tents at
night.&#xA0; Billiard balls just push on things.</p>
<p dragover="true">Try to put yourself in the shoes of the
hunter-gatherer who's never had the "Aha!" of information-processing.&#xA0; 
Try to avoid <a href="/lw/iz/failing_to_learn_from_history/">hindsight bias</a> about things like neurons and computers.&#xA0; Only then will you be able to see the uncrossable explanatory gap:</p>
<p dragover="true">How can you explain angry behavior in terms of billiard balls?</p>
<p dragover="true">Well, the <em>obvious</em>
materialist conjecture is that the little billiard balls push on your
arm and make you hit someone, or push on your tongue so that insults
come out.</p>
<p dragover="true">But how do the little billiard balls know how to do
this - or how to guide your tongue and fingers through long-term plots
- if they aren't angry themselves?</p>
<p dragover="true">And besides, if you're not seduced by - gasp! -
scientism, you can see from a first-person perspective that this
explanation is obviously false.&#xA0; Atoms can push on your arm, but they
can't make you <em>want</em> anything.

<p dragover="true">Someone may point out that drinking wine can make
you angry.&#xA0; But who says that wine is made exclusively of little
billiard balls?&#xA0; Maybe wine just contains a potency of angerness.</p>
<p dragover="true">Clearly, reductionism is just a flawed notion.</p>
<p dragover="true">(The novice goes astray and says "The art failed me"; the master goes astray and says "I failed my art.")</p>
<p dragover="true">What
does it take to cross this gap?&#xA0; It's not just the idea of "neurons"
that "process information" - if you say only this and nothing more, it just
inserts a magical, unexplained level-crossing rule into your model,
where you go from billiards to thoughts.</p>
<p dragover="true">But an Artificial Intelligence
programmer who knows how to create a chess-playing program out of base
matter, has taken a <em>genuine</em> step toward crossing the gap.&#xA0; If you understand concepts like <a href="/lw/l4/terminal_values_and_instrumental_values/">consequentialism</a>, backward chaining, utility functions, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">search trees</a>, you can make merely causal/mechanical systems compute plans.</p>
<p dragover="true">The trick goes something like this:&#xA0; For each possible chess move, compute the moves your opponent could
make, then your responses to those moves, and so on; evaluate the
furthest position you can see using some local algorithm (you might
simply count up the material); then trace back using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax</a> to find the best move on the current board; then make that move.</p>
<p dragover="true">More generally:&#xA0; If you have chains of causality
inside the mind that have a kind of mapping - a mirror, an echo - to
what goes on in the environment, then you can run a utility function
over the end products of imagination, and find an action that achieves
something which the utility function rates highly, and output that
action.&#xA0; It is not necessary for the chains of causality inside the
mind, that are similar to the environment, to be made out of billiard
balls that have little auras of intentionality.&#xA0; Deep Blue's
transistors do not need little chess pieces carved on them, in order to
work.&#xA0; See also <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/truth.html">The Simple Truth</a>.<br>
</p>
<p dragover="true">All this is still tremendously oversimplified, but
it should, at least, reduce the apparent length of the gap.&#xA0; If you can
understand all that, you can see how a planner built out of base matter
can be influenced by alcohol to output more angry behaviors.&#xA0; The
billiard balls in the alcohol push on the billiard balls making up the
utility function.<br>
</p>
<p dragover="true">But even if you know how to write small AIs, you can't <em>visualize</em> the level-crossing between transistors and chess.&#xA0; There are too many transistors, and too many moves to check.</p>
<p dragover="true">Likewise, even if you knew all the facts of neurology, you would not be able to <em>visualize</em>
the level-crossing between neurons and anger - let alone the
level-crossing between atoms and anger.&#xA0; Not the way you can visualize a
hand consisting of fingers, thumb, and palm.<br>
</p>
<p dragover="true">And suppose a cognitive scientist just <a href="/lw/op/fake_reductionism/">flatly tells</a> you "Anger is hormones"?&#xA0; Even if you repeat back the words, it doesn't mean you've crossed the gap.&#xA0; You may <a href="/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/">believe you believe it</a>, but that's not the same as understanding what little billiard balls have to do with wanting to hit someone.</p>
<p dragover="true">So you come up with interpretations like, "Anger is <em>mere</em> hormones, it's caused by little molecules, so it must not be justified in any moral sense - <em>that's</em> why you should learn to control your anger."</p>
<p dragover="true">Or, "There isn't really
any such thing as anger - it's an illusion, a quotation with no referent, like a
mirage of water in the desert, or looking in the garage for a dragon
and not finding one."</p>
<p dragover="true">These are both tough pills to swallow (not that
you <em>should</em> swallow them) and so it is a good easier to <a href="/lw/ir/science_as_attire/">profess</a> them than to believe them.</p>
<p dragover="true">I think this is what non-reductionists/non-materialists think they are criticizing when they criticize reductive materialism.</p>
<p dragover="true">But materialism isn't that easy.&#xA0; It's not as
cheap as saying, "Anger is made out of atoms - there, now I'm done."&#xA0; That
wouldn't explain how to get from billiard balls to hitting.&#xA0; You need the
specific insights of computation, consequentialism, and search trees
before you can start to close the explanatory gap.</p>
<p dragover="true">All this was a relatively easy example <em>by modern standards,</em> because I restricted myself to talking about angry <em>behaviors.</em>&#xA0; Talking about outputs doesn't require you to appreciate <a href="/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/">how an algorithm feels from inside</a> (cross a first-person/third-person gap) or <a href="/lw/og/wrong_questions/">dissolve a wrong question</a> (untangle places where the interior of your own mind runs skew to reality).</p>
<p dragover="true">Going from material substances that bend and break, burn and fall, push and shove, to angry <em>behavior,</em> is just a practice problem by the standards of modern philosophy.&#xA0; But it is an <em>important</em> practice problem.&#xA0; It can only be fully appreciated, if you realize how <em>hard</em> it would have been to solve before writing was invented.&#xA0; There was once an explanatory gap here - though it may not seem that way in <a href="/lw/iz/failing_to_learn_from_history/">hindsight</a>, now that it's been bridged for generations.</p>
<p dragover="true">Explanatory gaps can be crossed, if you accept help from science, and don't trust the view from the interior of your own mind.<br>
