As you may recall from some months earlier, I think that part of
the rationalist ethos is *binding yourself emotionally* to an
[absolutely lawful](/lw/hr/universal_law/)
[reductionistic](/lw/on/reductionism/) universe - a universe
containing
[no ontologically basic mental things](/lw/tv/excluding_the_supernatural/)
such as souls or
[magic](/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/) - and pouring
all your hope and all your care into that merely real universe and
its possibilities, without disappointment.

There's an old trick for combating
[dukkha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha) where you make a list
of things you're grateful for, like a roof over your head.

So why not make a list of abilities you have that would be
amazingly cool *if they were magic,* or
[if only a few chosen individuals had them](/lw/os/joy_in_discovery/)?

For example, suppose that instead of one eye, you possessed a
magical *second* eye embedded in your forehead.  And this second
eye enabled you to *see into the third dimension* - so that you
could somehow tell *how far away* things were - where an ordinary
eye would see only a two-dimensional shadow of the true world. 
Only the possessors of this ability can accurately aim the
legendary distance-weapons that kill at ranges far beyond a sword,
or use to their fullest potential the shells of ultrafast machinery
called "cars".

"Binocular vision" would be
[too light a term](http://chaitanya1.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/bigbang.gif)
for this ability.  We'll only appreciate it once it has a properly
impressive name, like Mystic Eyes of Depth Perception.

So here's a list of some of my favorite magical powers:



-   *Vibratory Telepathy*.  By transmitting invisible vibrations
    through the very air itself, two users of this ability can
    *share thoughts*.  As a result, Vibratory Telepaths can form
    emotional bonds much deeper than those possible to other primates.
-   *Psychometric Tracery.*  By tracing small fine lines on a
    surface, the Psychometric Tracer can leave impressions of emotions,
    history, knowledge, even the structure of other spells.  This is a
    higher level than Vibratory Telepathy as a Psychometric Tracer can
    share the thoughts of long-dead Tracers who lived thousands of
    years earlier.  By reading one Tracery and inscribing another
    simultaneously, Tracers can duplicate Tracings; and these
    replicated Tracings can even contain the detailed pattern of other
    spells and magics.  Thus, the Tracers wield almost unimaginable
    power as magicians; but Tracers can get in trouble trying to use
    complicated Traceries that they could not have Traced themselves.
-   *Multidimensional Kinesis.*  With simple, almost unthinking
    acts of will, the Kinetics can cause extraordinarily complex forces
    to flow through small tentacles and into any physical object within
    touching range - not just pushes, but combinations of pushes at
    many points that can effectively apply torques and twists.  The
    Kinetic ability is far subtler than it first appears: they use it
    not only to wield existing objects with martial precision, but also
    to apply forces that sculpt objects into forms more suitable for
    Kinetic wielding.  They even create tools that extend the power of
    their Kinesis and enable them to sculpt ever-finer and
    ever-more-complicated tools, a positive feedback loop fully as
    impressive as it sounds.
-   *The Eye.*  The user of this ability can perceive infinitesimal
    traveling twists in the Force that binds matter - tiny vibrations,
    akin to the life-giving power of the Sun that falls on leaves, but
    far more subtle.  A bearer of the Eye can sense objects far beyond
    the range of touch using the tiny disturbances they make in the
    Force.  Mountains many days travel away can be known to them as if
    within arm's reach.  According to the bearers of the Eye, when
    night falls and sunlight fails, they can sense huge fusion fires
    burning at unthinkable distances - though no one else has any way
    of verifying this.  Possession of a single Eye is said to make the
    bearer equivalent to royalty.

And finally,

-   *The Ultimate Power.*  The user of this ability contains a
    smaller, imperfect echo of the entire universe, enabling them to
    search out paths through probability to any desired future.  If
    this sounds like a ridiculously powerful ability, you're right -
    game balance goes right out the window with this one.  Extremely
    rare among life forms, it is the *sekai no ougi* or "hidden
    technique of the world".

Nothing can oppose the Ultimate Power except the Ultimate Power. 
Any less-than-ultimate Power will simply be "comprehended" by the
Ultimate and disrupted in some inconceivable fashion, or even
absorbed into the Ultimates' own power base.  For this reason the
Ultimate Power is sometimes called the "master technique of
techniques" or the "trump card that trumps all other trumps".  The
more powerful Ultimates can stretch their "comprehension" across
galactic distances and aeons of time, and even perceive the bizarre
laws of the hidden "world beneath the world".

Ultimates have been killed by immense natural catastrophes, or by
extremely swift surprise attacks that give them no chance to use
their power.  But all such victories are ultimately a matter of
luck - it does not confront the Ultimates on their own
probability-bending level, and if they survive they will begin to
bend Time to avoid future attacks.

But the Ultimate Power itself is also dangerous, and many Ultimates
have been destroyed by their own powers - falling into one of the
flaws in their imperfect inner echo of the world.

Stripped of weapons and armor and locked in a cell, an Ultimate is
still one of the most dangerous life-forms on the planet.  A sword
can be broken and a limb can be cut off, but the Ultimate Power is
"the power that cannot be removed without removing you".

Perhaps because this connection is so intimate, the Ultimates
regard one who loses their Ultimate Power permanently - without
hope of regaining it - as *schiavo,* or "dead while breathing". 
The Ultimates argue that the Ultimate Power is so important as to
be a necessary part of what makes a creature an end in itself,
rather than a means.  The Ultimates even insist that anyone who
lacks the Ultimate Power cannot begin to truly comprehend the
Ultimate Power, and hence, cannot understand why the Ultimate Power
is morally important - a suspiciously self-serving argument.

The users of this ability form an absolute aristocracy and treat
all other life forms as their pawns.
