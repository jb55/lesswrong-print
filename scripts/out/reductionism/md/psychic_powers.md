Well, that's a very intelligent argument, Benja Fallenstein.  But I
have a crushing reply to your argument, such that, once I deliver
it, you will at once give up further debate with me on this
particular point:

You're right.

Alas, I don't get modesty credit on this one, because after
publishing yesterday's post I realized a similar flaw on my own -
this one concerning Occam's Razor and psychic powers:

If beliefs and desires are irreducible and ontologically basic
entities, or have an ontologically basic *component* not covered by
existing science, that would make it far more likely that there was
an ontological rule governing the interaction of different minds -
an interaction which bypassed ordinary "material" means of
communication like sound waves, known to existing science.

If naturalism is correct, then there exists a conjugate
reductionist model that makes the *same predictions* as any
concrete prediction that any parapsychologist can make about
telepathy.

Indeed, if naturalism is correct, the only reason we can *conceive*
of beliefs as "fundamental" is due to lack of self-knowledge of our
own neurons - that the peculiar reflective architecture of our own
minds
[exposes the "belief" class](/lw/sp/detached_lever_fallacy/)[but hides the machinery behind it](/lw/sp/detached_lever_fallacy/).

Nonetheless, the discovery of information transfer between brains,
in the absence of any known material connection between them, is
*probabilistically* a privileged prediction of supernatural models
(those that contain ontologically basic mental entities).  Just
because it is so much *simpler* in that case to have a new law
relating beliefs between different minds, compared to the "boring"
model where beliefs are complex constructs of neurons.

The hope of psychic powers arises from treating beliefs and desires
as sufficiently fundamental objects that they can have *unmediated*
connections to reality.  If beliefs are patterns of neurons made of
known material, with inputs given by organs like eyes constructed
of known material, and with outputs through muscles constructed of
known material, and this seems sufficient to account for all known
mental powers of humans, then there's no reason to expect anything
more - no reason to postulate additional connections.  This is why
reductionists don't expect psychic powers.  Thus, observing psychic
powers would be strong evidence for the supernatural in
[Richard Carrier's](/lw/tv/excluding_the_supernatural/) sense.

We have an Occam rule that counts the number of ontologically basic
classes and ontologically basic laws in the model, and penalizes
the count of entities.  If naturalism is correct, then the attempt
to count "belief" or the "relation between belief and reality" as a
single basic entity, is simply misguided anthropomorphism; we are
only tempted to it by a quirk of our brain's internal
architecture.  But if you *just go with* that misguided view, then
it assigns a much higher probability to psychic powers than does
naturalism, because you can implement psychic powers using
apparently simpler laws.

Hence the actual discovery of psychic powers would imply that the
human-naive Occam rule was in fact better-calibrated than the
sophisticated naturalistic Occam rule.  It would argue that
reductionists had been wrong all along in trying to take apart the
brain; that what our minds exposed as a seemingly simple lever, was
in fact a simple lever.  The naive dualists would have been right
from the beginning, which is why their ancient wish would have been
enabled to come true.

So telepathy, and the ability to influence events just by wishing
at them, and precognition, would all, if discovered, be strong
Bayesian evidence in favor of the hypothesis that beliefs are
ontologically fundamental.  Not logical proof, but strong Bayesian
evidence.

If reductionism is correct, then any science-fiction story
containing psychic powers, can be output by a system of simple
elements (i.e., the story's author's brain); but if we *in fact*
discover psychic powers, that would make it much more probable that
events were occurring which could not *in fact* be described by
reductionist models.

Which just goes to say:  The existence of psychic powers is a
privileged probabilistic assertion of non-reductionist worldviews -
*they own* that advance prediction; they devised it and put it
forth, in defiance of reductionist expectations.  So by the laws of
science, if psychic powers are discovered, non-reductionism wins.

I am therefore [confident](/lw/ig/i_defy_the_data/) in dismissing
psychic powers as *a priori* implausible, despite all the claimed
experimental evidence in favor of them.
