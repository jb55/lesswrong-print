# Heat vs Motion

After yesterday's post, it occurred to me that there's a much
simpler example of reductionism jumping a gap of
apparent-difference-in-kind: the reduction of heat to motion.

Today, the equivalence of heat and motion may seem
[too obvious](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/failing-to-lear.html)
in
[hindsight](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/hindsight-deval.html)
-
[everyone says](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/cached-thoughts.html)
that "heat is motion", therefore, it can't be a
"[weird](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/cultish-counter.html)"
belief.

But there was a time when the
[kinetic theory of heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_heat)
was a highly controversial scientific hypothesis, contrasting to
belief in a [caloric fluid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric)
that flowed from hot objects to cold objects.  Still earlier, the
main theory of heat was
"[Phlogiston!](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-causality.html)"

Suppose you'd *separately* studied kinetic theory and caloric
theory.  You now know something about kinetics: collisions, elastic
rebounds, momentum, kinetic energy, gravity, inertia, free
trajectories.  Separately, you know something about heat: 
Temperatures, pressures, combustion, heat flows, engines, melting,
vaporization.

Not only is this state of knowledge a plausible one, it is the
state of knowledge possessed by e.g. Sadi Carnot, who, working
strictly from within the caloric theory of heat, developed the
principle of the Carnot cycle - a heat engine of maximum
efficiency, whose existence implies the
[second law of thermodynamics](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/second-law.html). 
This in 1824, when kinetics was a highly developed science.

Suppose, like Carnot, you know a great deal about kinetics, and a
great deal about heat, as *separate* entities.  Separate entities
*of knowledge*, that is: your brain has separate filing baskets for
beliefs about kinetics and beliefs about heat.  But
[from the inside](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/algorithm-feels.html),
this state of knowledge *feels* like living in a world of moving
things and hot things, a world where motion and heat are
independent properties of matter.

Now a Physicist From The Future comes along and tells you:  "Where
there is heat, there is motion, and vice versa.  That's why, for
example, rubbing things together makes them hotter."

There are (at least) two possible interpretations you could attach
to this statement, "Where there is heat, there is motion, and vice
versa."

First, you could suppose that heat and motion exist separately -
that the caloric theory is correct - but that among our universe's
physical laws is a "bridging law" which states that, where objects
are moving quickly, caloric will come into existence.  And
conversely, another bridging law says that caloric can exert
pressure on things and make them move, which is why a hotter gas
exerts more pressure on its enclosure (thus a steam engine can use
steam to drive a piston).

Second, you could suppose that heat and motion are, in some
as-yet-mysterious sense,*the same thing*.

"Nonsense," says Thinker 1, "the words 'heat' and 'motion' have two
different meanings; that is why we have two different words.  We
know how to determine when we will call an observed phenomenon
'heat' - heat can melt things, or make them burst into flame.  We
know how to determine when we will say that an object is 'moving
quickly' - it changes position; and when it crashes, it may deform,
or shatter.  Heat is concerned with change of substance; motion,
with change of position and shape.  To say that these two words
have the same meaning is simply to confuse yourself."

"Impossible," says Thinker 2.  "It may be that, in our world, heat
and motion are associated by bridging laws, so that it is a law of
physics that motion creates caloric, and vice versa.  But I can
easily imagine a world where rubbing things together does *not*
make them hotter, and gases *don't* exert more pressure at higher
temperatures.  Since there are possible worlds where heat and
motion are not associated, they must be different properties - this
is true a priori."

Thinker 1 is
[confusing the quotation and the referent](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/quote-not-refer.html). 
2 + 2 = 4, but "2 + 2" != "4".  The string "2 + 2" contains 5
characters (including whitespace) and the string "4" contains only
1 character.  If you type the two strings into a Python
interpreter, they yield the same output, -\> 4.  So you can't
conclude, from looking at the strings "2 + 2" and "4", that just
because the strings are different, they must have different
"meanings" relative to the Python Interpreter.

The words "heat" and "kinetic energy" can be said to "refer to" the
same thing, even before we *know* how heat reduces to motion, in
the sense that we don't know yet what the reference is, but the
references are in fact the same.  You might imagine an Idealized
Omniscient Science Interpreter that would give the same output when
we typed in "heat" and "kinetic energy" on the command line.

I talk about the Science Interpreter to emphasize that, to
dereference the pointer, you've got to step outside cognition.  The
end result of the dereference is something out there in reality,
not in anyone's mind.  So you can *say* "real referent" or "actual
referent", but you can't *evaluate* the words locally, from the
inside of your own head.  You can't reason using the actual
heat-referent - if you thought using *real heat*, thinking "1
million Kelvin" would vaporize your brain.  But, by forming a
belief about your belief about heat, you can talk *about* your
belief about heat, and say things like "It's possible that my
belief about heat doesn't much resemble *real* heat."  You can't
actually perform that comparison right there in your own mind, but
you can talk *about* it.

Hence you can say, "My beliefs about heat and motion are not the
same beliefs, but it's possible that actual heat and actual motion
are the same thing."  It's just like being able to acknowledge that
"the morning star" and "the evening star" might be the same planet,
while also understanding that you can't determine this just by
examining your beliefs - you've got to haul out the telescope.

Thinker 2's mistake follows similarly.  A physicist told him,
"Where there is heat, there is motion" and P2 mistook this for a
statement of *physical law*:  The presence of caloric *causes* the
existence of motion.  What the physicist really means is more akin
to an *inferential rule:*  Where you are told there is "heat",
deduce the presence of "motion".

From this basic projection of a multilevel model into a multilevel
reality follows another, distinct error: the conflation of
conceptual possibility with logical possibility.  To Sadi Carnot,
it is *conceivable* that there could be another world where heat
and motion are not associated.  To Richard Feynman, armed with
specific knowledge of how to derive equations about heat from
equations about motion, this idea is not only inconceivable, but so
wildly inconsistent as to make one's head explode. 

I should note, in fairness to philosophers, that there are
philosophers who have said these things.  For example, Hilary
Putnam,
[writing](http://books.google.com/books?id=cEPNtxAoYPAC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=h2o+logically+possible&source=web&ots=R9zyWvo3Uz&sig=FjyegdF0D-2I77l7dHQ-RRkSR88&hl=en)
on the "Twin Earth" thought experiment:

> Once we have discovered that water (in the actual world) is H20,
> *nothing counts as a possible world in which water isn't H20.*  In
> particular, if a "logically possible" statement is one that holds
> in some "logically possible world",
> *it isn't logically possible that water isn't H20.*

It appears to me that "water" is being used in two different senses
in these two paragraphs - one in which the word "water" *refers* to
what we type into the Science Interpreter, and one in which "water"
*refers* to what we get out of the Science Interpreter when we type
"water" into it.  In the first paragraph, Hilary seems to be saying
that after we do some experiments and find out that water is H20,
water becomes automatically redefined to *mean* H20.  But you could
coherently hold a different position about whether the word "water"
now *means* "H20" or "whatever is *really* in that bottle next to
me", so long as you use your terms consistently.

I believe the above has already been said as well?  Anyway...

It is quite possible for there to be only *one* thing
out-there-in-the-world, but for it to take on sufficiently
different forms, and for you yourself to be sufficiently ignorant
of the reduction, that it feels like living in a world containing
two entirely different things.  Knowledge concerning these two
different phenomena may taught in two different classes, and
studied by two different academic fields, located in two different
buildings of your university.

You've got to put yourself quite a ways back, into a historically
realistic frame of mind, to remember how *different* heat and
motion once seemed.  Though, depending on how much you know today,
it may not be as hard as all that, if you can look past the
pressure of conventionality (that is, "heat is motion" is an
un-weird belief, "heat is not motion" is a weird belief).  I mean,
suppose that tomorrow the physicists stepped forward and said, "Our
popularizations of science have always
[contained one lie](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/my-favorite-lia.html). 
Actually, heat has nothing to do with motion."  Could you *prove*
they were wrong?

Saying "Maybe heat and motion are the same thing!" is easy.  The
difficult part is explaining *how*.  It takes a great deal of
detailed knowledge to get yourself to the point where you can no
longer *conceive* of a world in which the two phenomena go separate
ways.  Reduction isn't cheap, and that's why it buys so much.

Or maybe you could say:  "Reductionism is easy, reduction is
hard."  But it does kinda help to be a reductionist, I think, when
it comes time to go looking for a reduction.
