# Awww, a Zebra

This image recently showed up on Flickr (original is nicer):

With the caption:

> *"Alas for those who turn their eyes from zebras and dream of dragons!  If we cannot learn to take joy in the merely real, our lives shall be empty indeed." -- Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.*

"Awww!", I said, and called over my girlfriend over to look.

"Awww!", she said, and then looked at me, and said,  "I think you
need to take your own advice!"

Me:  "But I'm looking at the zebra!"  
Her:  "*On a computer!*"  
Me:  *(Turns away, hides face.)*  
Her:  "Have you ever even *seen* a zebra in real life?"  
Me:  "Yes!  Yes, I have!  My parents took me to Lincoln Park Zoo! 
...man, I hated that place."
