You've got to admire that phrase, "dull catalogue of common
things".  What is it, exactly, that goes in this catalogue? 
Besides rainbows, that is?

Why, things that are mundane, of course.  Things that are normal;
things that are unmagical; things that are known, or knowable;
things that play by the rules (or that play by *any* rules, which
makes them boring); things that are part of the ordinary universe;
things that are, in a word, *real.*

Now that's what I call setting yourself up for a fall.

At that rate, sooner or later you're going to be disappointed in
*everything* - either it will turn out not to exist, or even worse,
it will turn out to be real.

If we cannot take joy in things that are merely real, our lives
will *always* be empty.

For what sin are rainbows demoted to the dull catalogue of common
things?  For the sin of having a scientific explanation.  "We know
her woof, her texture", says Keats - an interesting use of the word
"we", because I
[suspect that Keats didn't know](/lw/op/fake_reductionism/) the
explanation himself.  I suspect that just being
[told that someone else knew](/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/)
was too much for him to take.  I suspect that just the notion of
rainbows being scientifically explicable *in principle* would have
been too much to take.  And if Keats didn't think like that, well,
I know plenty of people who do.

I have already remarked that nothing is *inherently*
[mysterious](/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/) -
nothing that actually exists, that is.  If I am
[ignorant](/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/) about a phenomenon,
that is
[a fact about my state of mind](/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/),
not a fact about the phenomenon; to
[worship](/lw/j2/explainworshipignore/) a phenomenon because it
seems so wonderfully mysterious, is to worship your own ignorance;
a blank map does not correspond to a blank territory, it is just
somewhere we haven't visited yet, etc. etc...

Which is to say that *everything* - everything that
*actually*exists - is liable to end up in "the dull catalogue of
common things", sooner or later.

Your choice is either:

-   Decide that things are allowed to be unmagical, knowable,
    scientifically explicable, in a word, *real,* and yet still worth
    caring about;
-   Or go about the rest of your life suffering from existential
    ennui that is *unresolvable.*

(Self-deception might be an option for others, but
[not for you](/lw/je/doublethink_choosing_to_be_biased/).)

This puts quite a different complexion on the bizarre habit
indulged by those strange folk called *scientists,* wherein they
suddenly become fascinated by pocket lint or bird droppings or
rainbows, or some other ordinary thing which world-weary and
sophisticated folk would never give a second glance.

You might say that scientists - at least *some*scientists - are
those folk who are *in principle* capable of enjoying life in the
real universe.
