# Righting a Wrong Question

When you are faced with an *unanswerable* question - a question to
which it seems impossible to even *imagine* an answer - there is a
simple trick which can turn the question solvable.

Compare:

-   "Why do I have free will?"
-   "Why do I think I have free will?"

The nice thing about the second question is that it is *guaranteed*
to have a real answer, *whether or not* there is any such thing as
free will.  Asking "Why do I have free will?" or "Do I have free
will?" sends you off thinking about tiny details of the laws of
physics, so distant from the macroscopic level that you couldn't
begin to see them with the naked eye.  And you're asking "Why is X
the case?" where X may not be *coherent,* let alone the case.

"Why do I *think* I have free will?", in contrast, is guaranteed
answerable.  You do, in fact, believe you have free will.  This
belief seems far more solid and graspable than the ephemerality of
free will.  And there is, *in fact,* some nice solid chain of
cognitive cause and effect leading up to this belief.

If you've already outgrown free will, choose one of these
substitutes:

-   "Why does time move forward instead of backward?" versus "Why
    do I think time moves forward instead of backward?"
-   "Why was I born as myself rather than someone else?" versus
    "Why do I think I was born as myself rather than someone else?"
-   "Why am I conscious?" versus "Why do I think I'm conscious?"
-   "Why does reality exist?" versus "Why do I think reality
    exists?"

The beauty of this method is that it works *whether or not* the
question is confused.  As I type this, I am wearing socks.  I could
ask "Why am I wearing socks?" or "Why do I believe I'm wearing
socks?"  Let's say I ask the second question.  Tracing back the
chain of causality, I find:

-   I believe I'm wearing socks, because I can see socks on my
    feet.
-   I see socks on my feet, because my retina is sending sock
    signals to my visual cortex.
-   My retina is sending sock signals, because sock-shaped light is
    impinging on my retina.
-   Sock-shaped light impinges on my retina, because it reflects
    from the socks I'm wearing.
-   It reflects from the socks I'm wearing, because I'm wearing
    socks.
-   I'm wearing socks because I put them on.
-   I put socks on because I believed that otherwise my feet would
    get cold.
-   &c.

Tracing back the chain of causality, step by step, I discover that
my belief that I'm wearing socks is fully explained by the fact
that I'm wearing socks.  This is right and proper, as
[you cannot gain information about something without interacting with it](/lw/o6/perpetual_motion_beliefs/).

On the other hand, if I see a mirage of a lake in a desert, the
correct causal explanation of my vision does not involve the fact
of any actual lake in the desert.  In this case, my belief in the
lake is not just *explained,* but *explained away.*

But *either way,* the belief itself is a real phenomenon taking
place in the real universe - psychological events are events - and
its causal history can be traced back.

"Why is there a lake in the middle of the desert?" may fail if
there is no lake to be explained.  But "Why do I *perceive* a lake
in the middle of the desert?" always has a causal explanation, one
way or the other.

Perhaps someone will see an opportunity to be clever, and say: 
"Okay.  I believe in free will because I have free will.  There,
I'm done."  Of course it's not that easy.

My perception of socks on my feet, is an event in the visual
cortex.  The workings of the visual cortex can be investigated by
cognitive science, should they be confusing.

My retina receiving light is not a mystical sensing procedure, a
magical sock detector that lights in the presence of socks for no
explicable reason; there are mechanisms that can be understood in
terms of biology.  The photons entering the retina can be
understood in terms of optics.  The shoe's surface reflectance can
be understood in terms of electromagnetism and chemistry.  My feet
getting cold can be understood in terms of thermodynamics.

So it's not as easy as saying, "I believe I have free will because
I have it - there, I'm done!"  You have to be able to break the
causal chain into smaller steps, and explain the steps in terms of
elements not themselves confusing.

The mechanical interaction of my retina with my socks is quite
clear, and can be described in terms of non-confusing components
like photons and electrons.  Where's the free-will-sensor in your
brain, and how does it detect the presence or absence of free
will?  How does the sensor interact with the sensed event, and what
are the mechanical details of the interaction?

If your belief does derive from valid observation of a real
phenomenon, we will eventually reach that fact, if we start tracing
the causal chain backward from your belief.

If what you are really seeing is your own confusion, tracing back
the chain of causality will find an algorithm that
[runs skew to reality](/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/).

Either way, the question is guaranteed to have an answer.  You even
have a nice, concrete place to begin tracing - your belief, sitting
there solidly in your mind.

Cognitive science may not seem so lofty and glorious as
metaphysics.  But at least questions of cognitive science are
*solvable.*  Finding an answer may not be *easy,* but at least an
answer *exists.*

Oh, and also: the idea that cognitive science is not so lofty and
glorious as metaphysics is simply wrong.  Some readers are
beginning to notice this, I hope.
