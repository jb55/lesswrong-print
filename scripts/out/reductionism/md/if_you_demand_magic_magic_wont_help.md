Once upon a time, I was pondering the philosophy of fantasy stories

And before anyone chides me for my "failure to understand what
fantasy is about", let me say this:  I was raised in an SF&F
household.  I have been reading fantasy stories since I was five
years old.  I occasionally try to *write* fantasy
[stories](http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction).  And I am *not* the
sort of person who tries to write for a genre without pondering its
philosophy.  Where do you think story ideas come from?

Anyway:

I was pondering the philosophy of fantasy stories, and it occurred
to me that if there were actually dragons in our world - if you
could go down to the zoo, or even to a distant mountain, and meet a
fire-breathing dragon - while nobody had ever actually seen a
zebra, then our fantasy stories would contain zebras aplenty, while
dragons would be unexciting.

Now that's what I call painting yourself into a corner, wot?  The
grass is always greener on the other side of unreality.



In one of the standard fantasy plots, a protagonist from our Earth,
a sympathetic character with lousy grades or a crushing mortgage
but still a good heart,
[suddenly finds themselves in a world](/lw/hq/universal_fire/)
where magic operates in place of science.  The protagonist often
goes on to practice magic, and become in due course a
(superpowerful) sorcerer.

Now here's the question - and yes, it is a little unkind, but I
think it needs to be asked:  Presumably most readers of these
novels see themselves in the protagonist's shoes, fantasizing about
their own acquisition of sorcery.  Wishing for magic.  And, barring
improbable demographics, most readers of these novels are not
scientists.

Born into a world of science, they did not become scientists.  What
makes them think that, in a world of magic, they would act any
differently?

If they don't have the scientific attitude, that
[nothing is "mere"](/lw/or/joy_in_the_merely_real/) - the capacity
to be interested in merely real things - how will magic help them? 
If they actually *had* magic, it would be merely *real,* and lose
the charm of unattainability.  They might be excited at first, but
(like the lottery winners who, six months later, aren't nearly as
happy as they expected to be), the excitement would soon wear off. 
Probably as soon as they had to actually *study*spells.

*Unless* they can find the capacity to take joy in things that are
merely real.  To be just as excited by hang-gliding, as riding a
dragon; to be as excited by making a light with electricity, as by
making a light with magic... even if it takes a little study...

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not dissing dragons.  Who knows, we might
even create some, one of these days.

But if you don't have the capacity to enjoy hang-gliding even
though it is *merely real*, then as soon as dragons *turn* real,
you're not going to be any more excited by dragons than you are by
hang-gliding.

Do you think you would prefer living in the Future, to living in
the present?  That's a quite understandable preference.  Things do
seem to be getting better over time.

But don't forget that *this is* the Future, relative to the Dark
Ages of a thousand years earlier.  You have opportunities
undreamt-of even by kings.

If the trend continues, the Future might be a very fine place
indeed in which to live.  But if you do make it to the Future, what
you find, when you get there, will be another Now.  If you don't
have the basic capacity to enjoy being in a Now - if your emotional
energy can *only* go into the Future, if you can *only*hope for a
better tomorrow - then no amount of passing time can help you.

(Yes, in the Future there could be a pill that fixes the emotional
problem of always looking to the Future.  I don't think this
invalidates my basic point, which is about what sort of pills we
should want to take.)

Matthew C.,
[commenting here on OB](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/reductionism.html#comment-107342714),
seems very excited about an informally specified "theory" by Rupert
Sheldrake which "[explains](/lw/is/fake_causality/)" such
non-explanation-demanding phenomena as protein folding and
snowflake symmetry.  But why isn't Matthew C. just as excited
about, say, Special Relativity?  Special Relativity is actually
*known* to be a law, so why isn't it even *more* exciting?  The
advantage of becoming excited about a law already known to be true,
is that you know your excitement will not be wasted.

If Sheldrake's theory were accepted truth taught in elementary
schools, Matthew C. wouldn't care about it.  Or why else is Matthew
C. fascinated by that one particular law which he believes to be a
law of physics, more than all the other laws?

The worst catastrophe you could visit upon the New Age community
would be for their rituals to start working reliably, and for UFOs
to actually appear in the skies.  What would be the point of
believing in aliens, if they were just *there,* and everyone else
could see them too?  In a world where psychic powers were merely
real, New Agers wouldn't *believe in* psychic powers, any more than
anyone cares enough about gravity to believe in it.  (Except for
scientists, of course.)

Why am I so negative about magic?  Would it be *wrong* for magic to
exist?

I'm not actually negative on magic.  Remember, I occasionally try
to write fantasy stories.  But I'm annoyed with this psychology
that, if it were born into a world where spells and potions did
work, would pine away for a world where household goods were
abundantly produced by assembly lines.

Part of binding yourself to reality, on an emotional as well as
intellectual level, is coming to terms with the fact that you
*do live here.*  Only then can you see this, your world, and
whatever opportunities it holds out for you, without wishing your
sight away.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but*I've* found no lack of
dragons to fight, or magics to master, in this world of my birth. 
If I were transported into one of those fantasy novels, I wouldn't
be surprised to find myself studying the forbidden ultimate sorcery
-

- because why should being transported into a magical world change
anything?  It's not *where* you are, it's *who* you are.

So remember the Litany Against Being Transported Into An Alternate
Universe:

If I'm going to be happy anywhere,  
Or achieve greatness anywhere,  
Or learn true secrets anywhere,  
Or save the world anywhere,  
Or feel strongly anywhere,  
Or help people anywhere,  
I may as well do it in reality.
