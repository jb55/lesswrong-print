# Initiation Ceremony

    The torches that lit the narrow stairwell burned intensely and
in the wrong color, flame like melting gold or shattered suns.  
*    192... 193...*  
    Brennan's sandals clicked softly on the stone steps, snicking
in sequence, like dominos very slowly falling.  
*    227... 228...*  
    Half a circle ahead of him, a trailing fringe of dark cloth
whispered down the stairs, the robed figure itself staying just out
of sight.  
    *239... 240...*  
    *Not much longer,* Brennan predicted to himself, and his guess
was accurate:  
    Sixteen times sixteen steps was the number, and they stood
before the portal of glass.  
    The great curved gate had been wrought with cunning, humor, and
close attention to indices of refraction: it warped light, bent it,
folded it, and generally abused it, so that there were hints of
what was on the other side (stronger light sources, dark walls) but
no possible way of *seeing through* - unless, of course, you had
the key: the counter-door, thick for thin and thin for thick, in
which case the two would cancel out.  
    From the robed figure beside Brennan, two hands emerged, gloved
in reflective cloth to conceal skin's color.  Fingers like slim
mirrors grasped the handles of the warped gate - handles that
Brennan had not guessed; in all that distortion, shapes could only
be anticipated, not seen.  
    "Do you want to know?" whispered the guide; a whisper nearly as
loud as an ordinary voice, but not revealing the slightest hint of
gender.  
    Brennan paused.  The answer to the question seemed
suspiciously, indeed extraordinarily obvious, even for ritual.



    "Yes," Brennan said finally.  
    The guide only regarded him silently.  
    "Yes, I want to know," said Brennan.  
    "Know *what,* exactly?" whispered the figure.  
    Brennan's face scrunched up in concentration, trying to
visualize the game to its end, and hoping he hadn't blown it
already; until finally he fell back on the first and last resort,
which is the truth:  
    "It doesn't matter," said Brennan, "the answer is still yes."  
    The glass gate parted down the middle, and slid, with only the
tiniest scraping sound, into the surrounding stone.  
    The revealed room was lined, wall-to-wall, with figures robed
and hooded in light-absorbing cloth.  The straight walls were not
themselves black stone, but mirrored, tiling a square grid of dark
robes out to infinity in all directions; so that it seemed as if
the people of some much vaster city, or perhaps the whole human
kind, watched in assembly.  There was a hint of moist warmth in the
air of the room, the breath of the gathered: a scent of crowds.  
    Brennan's guide moved to the center of the square, where burned
four torches of that relentless yellow flame.  Brennan followed,
and when he stopped, he realized with a slight shock that all the
cowled hoods were now looking directly at him.  Brennan had never
before in his life been the focus of such absolute attention; it
was frightening, but not entirely unpleasant.  
    "He is here," said the guide in that strange loud whisper.  
    The endless grid of robed figures replied in one voice:
perfectly blended, exactly synchronized, so that not a single
individual could be singled out from the rest, and betrayed:  
    "*Who is absent?*"  
    "Jakob Bernoulli," intoned the guide, and the walls replied:  
    "*Is dead but not forgotten.*"  
    "Abraham de Moivre,"  
    "*Is dead but not forgotten.*"  
    "Pierre-Simon Laplace,"  
    "*Is dead but not forgotten.*"  
    "Edwin Thompson Jaynes,"  
    "*Is dead but not forgotten.*"  
    "They died," said the guide, "and they are lost to us; but we
still have each other, and the project continues."  
    In the silence, the guide turned to Brennan, and stretched
forth a hand, on which rested a small ring of nearly transparent
material.  
    * *Brennan stepped forward to take the ring -  
    But the hand clenched tightly shut.  
    "If three-fourths of the humans in this room are women," said
the guide, "and three-fourths of the women and half of the men
belong to the Heresy of Virtue, and I am a Virtuist, what is the
probability that I am a man?"  
    "Two-elevenths," Brennan said confidently.  
    There was a moment of absolute silence.  
    Then a titter of shocked laughter.  
    The guide's whisper came again, truly quiet this time, almost
nonexistent:  "It's one-sixth, actually."  
    Brennan's cheeks were flaming so hard that he thought his face
might melt off.  The instinct was very strong to run out of the
room and up the stairs and flee the city and change his name and
start his life over again and get it right this time.  
    "An honest mistake is at least honest," said the guide, louder
now, "and we may know the honesty by its relinquishment.  If I am a
Virtuist, what is the probability that I am a man?"  
    "One -" Brennan started to say.  
    Then he stopped.  Again, the horrible silence.  
    "Just say 'one-sixth' already," stage-whispered the figure,
this time loud enough for the walls to hear; then there was more
laughter, not all of it kind.  
    Brennan was breathing rapidly and there was sweat on his
forehead.  If he was wrong about this, he really *was* going to
flee the city.  "Three fourths women times three fourths Virtuists
is nine sixteenths female Virtuists in this room.  One fourth men
times one half Virtuists is two sixteenths male Virtuists.  If I
have only that information and the fact that you are a Virtuist, I
would then estimate odds of two to nine, or a probability of
two-elevenths, that you are male.  Though I do not, in fact,
believe the information given is correct.  For one thing, it seems
too neat.  For another, there are an odd number of people in this
room."  
    The hand stretched out again, and opened.  
    Brennan took the ring.  It looked almost invisible, in the
torchlight; not glass, but some material with a refractive index
very close to air.  The ring was warm from the guide's hand, and
felt like a tiny living thing as it embraced his finger.  
    The relief was so great that he nearly didn't hear the cowled
figures applauding.  
    From the robed guide came one last whisper:  
    "You are now a novice of the Bayesian Conspiracy."
