# Amazing Breakthrough Day 1: April 1st

So you're thinking, "April 1st... isn't that already supposed to be
April Fool's Day?"

Yes - and that will provide the ideal cover for celebrating Amazing
Breakthrough Day.

As I argued in
"[The Beauty of Settled Science](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/beauty-settled.html)",
it is a major problem that media coverage of science focuses only
on *breaking news.*  Breaking news, in science, occurs at the
furthest fringes of the scientific frontier, which means that the
new discovery is often:

-   Controversial
-   Supported by only one experiment
-   Way the heck more complicated than an ordinary mortal can
    handle, and requiring lots of prerequisite science to understand,
    which is why it wasn't solved three centuries ago
-   Later shown to be wrong

People never get to see the *solid* stuff, let alone the
*understandable* stuff, because it isn't *breaking news*.

On Amazing Breakthrough Day, I propose, journalists who really care
about science can report - under the protective cover of April 1st
- such important but neglected science stories as:

-   BOATS EXPLAINED:  Centuries-Old Problem Solved By
    [Bathtub Nudist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes)
-   YOU SHALL NOT CROSS! 
    [Kรถnigsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_Königsberg)
    Tourists' Hopes Dashed
-   ARE YOUR LUNGS ON *FIRE*?  Link Between
    [Respiration And Combustion](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/04/universal_fire.html)
    Gains Acceptance Among Scientists

Note that every one of these headlines are *true* - they describe
events that did, in fact, happen.  They just didn't happen
*yesterday.*

There have been many humanly understandable amazing breakthroughs
in the history of science, which can be understood without a PhD or
even BSc.  The operative word here is *history.*  Think of
Archimedes's "Eureka!" when he understood the relation between the
water a ship displaces, and the reason the ship floats.  This is
*far enough back* in scientific history that you don't need to know
50 other discoveries to understand the theory; it can be explained
in a couple of graphs; anyone can see how it's useful; and the
confirming experiments can be duplicated in your own bathtub.

Modern science is built on discoveries built on discoveries built
on discoveries and so on all the way back to Archimedes.  Reporting
science *only* as breaking news is like wandering into a movie
3/4ths of the way through, writing a story about "Bloody-handed man
kisses girl holding gun!" and wandering back out again.

And if your editor says, "Oh, but our readers won't be interested
in that -"

Then point out that Reddit and Digg don't link *only* to breaking
news.  They also link to short webpages that give good explanations
of old science.  Readers vote it up, and that should tell you
something.  Explain that if your newspaper doesn't change to look
more like Reddit, you'll have to start selling drugs to make
payroll.   Editors love to hear that sort of thing, right?

On the Internet, a good new explanation of old science *is*news and
it spreads like news.  Why couldn't the science sections of
newspapers work the same way?  Why isn't a new *explanation* worth
reporting on?

But all this is too visionary for a first step.  For now, let's
just see if any journalists out there pick up on Amazing
Breakthrough Day, where you report on some *understandable* science
breakthrough as though it had just occurred.

April 1st.  Put it on your calendar.
