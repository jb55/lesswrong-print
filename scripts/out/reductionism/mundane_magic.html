<p>As you may recall from some months earlier, I think that part of the rationalist ethos is <em>binding yourself emotionally</em> to an <a href="/lw/hr/universal_law/">absolutely lawful</a> <a href="/lw/on/reductionism/">reductionistic</a> universe - a universe containing <a href="/lw/tv/excluding_the_supernatural/">no ontologically basic mental things</a> such as souls or <a href="/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/">magic</a> - and pouring all your hope and all your care into that merely real universe and its possibilities, without disappointment.</p>
<p>There's an old trick for combating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">dukkha</a> where you make a list of things you're grateful for, like a roof over your head.</p>
<p>So why not make a list of abilities you have that would be amazingly cool <em>if they were magic,</em> or <a href="/lw/os/joy_in_discovery/">if only a few chosen individuals had them</a>?</p>
<p>For example, suppose that instead of one eye, you possessed a magical <em>second</em> eye embedded in your forehead.&#xA0; And this second eye enabled you to <em>see into the third dimension</em> - so that you could somehow tell <em>how far away</em> things were - where an ordinary eye would see only a two-dimensional shadow of the true world.&#xA0; Only the possessors of this ability can accurately aim the legendary distance-weapons that kill at ranges far beyond a sword, or use to their fullest potential the shells of ultrafast machinery called "cars".</p>
<p>"Binocular vision" would be <a href="http://chaitanya1.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/bigbang.gif">too light a term</a> for this ability.&#xA0; We'll only appreciate it once it has a properly impressive name, like Mystic Eyes of Depth Perception.</p>
<p>So here's a list of some of my favorite magical powers:</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Vibratory Telepathy</em>.&#xA0; By transmitting invisible vibrations through the very air itself, two users of this ability can <em>share thoughts</em>.&#xA0; As a result, Vibratory Telepaths can form emotional bonds much deeper than those possible to other primates.</li>
<li><em>Psychometric Tracery.</em>&#xA0; By tracing small fine lines on a surface, the Psychometric Tracer can leave impressions of emotions, history, knowledge, even the structure of other spells.&#xA0; This is a higher level than Vibratory Telepathy as a Psychometric Tracer can share the thoughts of long-dead Tracers who lived thousands of years earlier.&#xA0; By reading one Tracery and inscribing another simultaneously, Tracers can duplicate Tracings; and these replicated Tracings can even contain the detailed pattern of other spells and magics.&#xA0; Thus, the Tracers wield almost unimaginable power as magicians; but Tracers can get in trouble trying to use complicated Traceries that they could not have Traced themselves.</li>
<li><em>Multidimensional Kinesis.</em>&#xA0; With simple, almost unthinking acts of will, the Kinetics can cause extraordinarily complex forces to flow through small tentacles and into any physical object within touching range - not just pushes, but combinations of pushes at many points that can effectively apply torques and twists.&#xA0; The Kinetic ability is far subtler than it first appears: they use it not only to wield existing objects with martial precision, but also to apply forces that sculpt objects into forms more suitable for Kinetic wielding.&#xA0; They even create tools that extend the power of their Kinesis and enable them to sculpt ever-finer and ever-more-complicated tools, a positive feedback loop fully as impressive as it sounds.</li>
<li><em>The Eye.</em>&#xA0; The user of this ability can perceive infinitesimal traveling twists in the Force that binds matter - tiny vibrations, akin to the life-giving power of the Sun that falls on leaves, but far more subtle.&#xA0; A bearer of the Eye can sense objects far beyond the range of touch using the tiny disturbances they make in the Force.&#xA0; Mountains many days travel away can be known to them as if within arm's reach.&#xA0; According to the bearers of the Eye, when night falls and sunlight fails, they can sense huge fusion fires burning at unthinkable distances - though no one else has any way of verifying this.&#xA0; Possession of a single Eye is said to make the bearer equivalent to royalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The Ultimate Power.</em>&#xA0; The user of this ability contains a smaller, imperfect echo of the entire universe, enabling them to search out paths through probability to any desired future.&#xA0; If this sounds like a ridiculously powerful ability, you're right - game balance goes right out the window with this one.&#xA0; Extremely rare among life forms, it is the <em>sekai no ougi</em> or "hidden technique of the world".</p>
<p>Nothing can oppose the Ultimate Power except the Ultimate Power.&#xA0; Any less-than-ultimate Power will simply be "comprehended" by the Ultimate and disrupted in some inconceivable fashion, or even absorbed into the Ultimates' own power base.&#xA0; For this reason the Ultimate Power is sometimes called the "master technique of techniques" or the "trump card that trumps all other trumps".&#xA0; The more powerful Ultimates can stretch their "comprehension" across galactic distances and aeons of time, and even perceive the bizarre laws of the hidden "world beneath the world".</p>
<p>Ultimates have been killed by immense natural catastrophes, or by extremely swift surprise attacks that give them no chance to use their power.&#xA0; But all such victories are ultimately a matter of luck - it does not confront the Ultimates on their own probability-bending level, and if they survive they will begin to bend Time to avoid future attacks.</p>
<p>But the Ultimate Power itself is also dangerous, and many Ultimates have been destroyed by their own powers - falling into one of the flaws in their imperfect inner echo of the world.</p>
<p>Stripped of weapons and armor and locked in a cell, an Ultimate is still one of the most dangerous life-forms on the planet.&#xA0; A sword can be broken and a limb can be cut off, but the Ultimate Power is "the power that cannot be removed without removing you".</p>
<p>Perhaps because this connection is so intimate, the Ultimates regard one who loses their Ultimate Power permanently - without hope of regaining it - as <em>schiavo,</em> or "dead while breathing".&#xA0; The Ultimates argue that the Ultimate Power is so important as to be a necessary part of what makes a creature an end in itself, rather than a means.&#xA0; The Ultimates even insist that anyone who lacks the Ultimate Power cannot begin to truly comprehend the Ultimate Power, and hence, cannot understand why the Ultimate Power is morally important - a suspiciously self-serving argument.</p>
<p>The users of this ability form an absolute aristocracy and treat all other life forms as their pawns.</p>
