<p>So perhaps you're reading all this, and asking:&#xA0; "Yes, but what does this have to do with <a href="/lw/on/reductionism/">reductionism</a>?"</p>
<p>Partially, it's a matter of <a href="/lw/o4/leave_a_line_of_retreat/">leaving a line of retreat</a>.&#xA0; It's not easy to take something <em>important</em> apart into components, when you're convinced that this removes magic from the world, unweaves the rainbow.&#xA0; I do plan to take certain things apart, on this blog; and I prefer not to create pointless existential anguish.</p>
<p>Partially, it's the crusade against Hollywood Rationality, the concept that understanding the rainbow subtracts its beauty.&#xA0; The rainbow is still beautiful <em>plus</em> you get the beauty of physics.</p>
<p>But even more deeply, it's one of these subtle <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/virtues/">hidden-core-of-rationality</a> things.&#xA0; You know, the sort of thing where I start talking about '<a href="/lw/m7/zen_and_the_art_of_rationality/">the Way</a>'.&#xA0; It's about <em>binding yourself to reality.</em></p>
<p>In one of Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> books, IIRC, it is said that a Truthsayer gains their ability to detect lies in others by always speaking truth themselves, so that they form a relationship with the truth whose violation they can feel.&#xA0; It wouldn't work, but I still think it's one of the more beautiful thoughts in fiction.&#xA0; At the very least, to get close to the truth, you have to be willing to press yourself up against reality as tightly as possible, without flinching away, or sneering down.</p><a id="more"></a><p>You can see the bind-yourself-to-reality theme in "<a href="/lw/hl/lotteries_a_waste_of_hope/">Lotteries:&#xA0; A Waste of Hope</a>."&#xA0; 
Understanding that lottery tickets have negative expected utility, does
not mean that you give up the hope of being rich.&#xA0; It means that you
stop wasting that hope on lottery tickets.&#xA0; You put the hope into your
job, your school, your startup, your eBay sideline; and
if you truly have nothing worth hoping for, then maybe it's time to start looking.<br>
</p>
<p>It's not dreams I object to, only <em>impossible</em>
dreams.&#xA0; The lottery isn't impossible, but it is an un-actionable
near-impossibility.&#xA0; It's not that winning the lottery is extremely <em>difficult</em> - requires a desperate effort - but that <em>work </em>isn't the issue.<br>
</p>
<p>I say all this, to exemplify the idea of taking emotional energy
that is flowing off to nowhere, and binding it into the realms of
reality.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean setting goals that are low enough to be
"realistic", i.e., easy and safe and parentally approved.&#xA0; Maybe this is good advice in your personal case, I don't know, but I'm not the one to say it.</p>
<p>What I mean is that you can invest emotional energy in rainbows even if they turn out <em>not</em> to be magic.&#xA0; <a href="/lw/j6/why_is_the_future_so_absurd/">The future is always absurd</a> but it is never <em>unreal.</em></p>
<p>The Hollywood Rationality stereotype is that "rational = emotionless"; the more reasonable you are, the more of your emotions Reason inevitably destroys.&#xA0; In "<a href="/lw/hp/feeling_rational/">Feeling Rational</a>" I contrast this against <em>"That which can be destroyed by the truth should be"</em> and <em>"That which the truth nourishes should thrive".</em>&#xA0; When you have arrived at your best picture of the truth, there is nothing irrational about the emotions you feel as a result of that - the emotions cannot be destroyed by truth, so they must not be irrational.</p>
<p>So instead of <em>destroying</em> emotional energies associated with bad explanations for rainbows, as the Hollywood Rationality stereotype would have it, let us <em>redirect</em> these emotional energies into reality - bind them to beliefs that are as true as we can make them.</p>
<p>Want to fly?&#xA0; Don't give up on flight.&#xA0; Give up on flying potions and build yourself an airplane.</p>
<p>Remember the theme of "<a href="/lw/hs/think_like_reality/">Think Like Reality</a>", where I talked about how when physics seems counterintuitive, you've got to accept that it's not <em>physics</em> that's weird, it's <em>you</em>?</p>
<p>What I'm talking about now is like that, only with <a href="/lw/hp/feeling_rational/">emotions</a>
instead of hypotheses - binding your feelings into the real world.&#xA0; Not
the "realistic" everyday world.&#xA0; I would be a howling hypocrite if I
told you to shut up and do your homework.&#xA0; I mean the <em>real</em> real world, the <a href="/lw/hr/universal_law/">lawful universe</a>, that includes <a href="/lw/j6/why_is_the_future_so_absurd/">absurdities</a> like Moon landings and the evolution of human intelligence.&#xA0; Just not any magic, anywhere, ever<em>.</em></p>
<p>It is a Hollywood Rationality meme that "Science takes the fun out of life."

</p>
<p>Science puts the fun back <em>into</em> life.</p>
<p>Rationality directs your emotional energies into the universe, rather than somewhere else.</p></div></div></div>
