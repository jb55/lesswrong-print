  <div><p>So you're thinking, "April 1st... isn't that already supposed to be April Fool's Day?"</p>
<p>Yes - and that will provide the ideal cover for celebrating Amazing Breakthrough Day.</p>
<p>As I argued in "<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/beauty-settled.html">The Beauty of Settled Science</a>", it is a major problem that media coverage of science focuses only on <em>breaking news.</em>&#xA0; Breaking news, in science, occurs at the furthest fringes of the scientific frontier, which means that the new discovery is often:</p>
<ul><li>Controversial</li>
<li>Supported by only one experiment</li>
<li>Way the heck more complicated than an ordinary mortal can handle, and requiring lots of prerequisite science to understand, which is why it wasn't solved three centuries ago</li>
<li>Later shown to be wrong</li></ul>
<p>People never get to see the <em>solid</em> stuff, let alone the <em>understandable</em> stuff, because it isn't <em>breaking news</em>.

</p>
<p>On Amazing Breakthrough Day, I propose, journalists who really care about science can report - under the protective cover of April 1st - such important but neglected science stories as:</p>
<ul><li>BOATS EXPLAINED:&#xA0; Centuries-Old Problem Solved By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Bathtub Nudist</a> </li>
<li>YOU SHALL NOT CROSS!&#xA0; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">K&#xE23;&#xE16;nigsberg</a> Tourists' Hopes Dashed</li>
<li>ARE YOUR LUNGS ON <em>FIRE</em>?&#xA0; Link Between <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/04/universal_fire.html">Respiration And Combustion</a> Gains Acceptance Among Scientists</li></ul><a id="more"></a><p>Note that every one of these headlines are <em>true</em> - they describe events that did, in fact, happen.&#xA0; They just didn't happen <em>yesterday.</em></p>
<p>There have been many humanly understandable amazing breakthroughs in
the history of science, which can be understood without a PhD or even
BSc.&#xA0; The operative word here is <em>history.</em>&#xA0; Think of
Archimedes's "Eureka!" when he understood the relation between the
water a ship displaces, and the reason the ship floats.&#xA0; This is <em>far enough back</em> in scientific history that you don't need to know 50 other discoveries to understand the theory; it can be explained in a couple of graphs; anyone can see how it's useful; and the confirming experiments can be duplicated in your own bathtub.</p>
<p>Modern science is built on discoveries built on discoveries built on discoveries and so on all the way back to Archimedes.&#xA0; Reporting science <em>only</em> as breaking news is like wandering into a movie 3/4ths of the way through, writing a story about "Bloody-handed man kisses girl holding gun!" and wandering back out again.</p>
<p>And if your editor says, "Oh, but our readers won't be interested in that -"</p>
<p>Then point out that Reddit and Digg don't link <em>only</em> to breaking news.&#xA0; They also link to short webpages that give good explanations of old science.&#xA0; Readers vote it up, and that should tell you something.&#xA0; Explain that if your newspaper doesn't change to look more like Reddit, you'll have to start selling drugs to make payroll.&#xA0; &#xA0;Editors love to hear that sort of thing, right?</p>
<p>On the Internet, a good new explanation of old science <em>is </em>news and it spreads like news.&#xA0; Why couldn't the science sections of newspapers work the same way?&#xA0; Why isn't a new <em>explanation</em> worth reporting on?</p>
<p>But all this is too visionary for a first step.&#xA0; For now, let's just see if any journalists out there pick up on Amazing Breakthrough Day, where you report on some <em>understandable</em> science breakthrough as though it had just occurred.</p>
<p>April 1st.&#xA0; Put it on your calendar.</p></div></div></div>
