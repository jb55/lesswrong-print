  <div><p>FADE IN around a serious-looking group of uniformed military officers.&#xA0; At the head of the table, a senior, heavy-set man, GENERAL FRED, speaks.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; The reports are confirmed.&#xA0; New York has been overrun... by <em>zombies</em>.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; Again?&#xA0; But we just had a zombie invasion 28 days ago!</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; These zombies... are different.&#xA0; They're... <em>philosophical</em> zombies.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&#xA0; Are they filled with rage, causing them to bite people?</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; Do they lose all capacity for reason?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; No.&#xA0; They behave... <em>exactly</em> like we do... except that they're not conscious.</p>
<p>(<em>Silence grips the table.</em>)</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; Dear God.</p><a id="more"></a><p>GENERAL FRED moves over to a computerized display.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; This is New York City, two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The display shows crowds bustling through the streets, people eating in restaurants, a garbage truck hauling away trash.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; <em>This...</em> is New York City... <em>now.</em></p>
<p>The display changes, showing a crowded subway train, a group of students laughing in a park, and a couple holding hands in the sunlight.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; It's worse than I imagined.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&#xA0; How can you tell, exactly?</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; I've never seen anything so brutally ordinary.</p>
<p>A lab-coated SCIENTIST stands up at the foot of the table.</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&#xA0; The zombie disease eliminates consciousness without changing the brain in any way.&#xA0; We've been trying to understand how the disease is transmitted.&#xA0; Our conclusion is that, since the disease attacks dual properties of ordinary matter, it must, itself, operate outside our universe.&#xA0; We're dealing with an <em>epiphenomenal virus</em>.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; Are you sure?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&#xA0; As sure as we can be in the total absence of evidence.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; All right.&#xA0; Compile a report on every epiphenomenon ever observed.&#xA0; What, where, and who.&#xA0; I want a list of everything that hasn't happened in the last fifty years.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&#xA0; If the virus is epiphenomenal, how do we know it exists?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&#xA0; The same way we know <em>we're</em> conscious.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&#xA0; Oh, okay.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; Have the doctors made any progress on finding an epiphenomenal cure?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&#xA0; They've tried every placebo in the book.&#xA0; No dice.&#xA0; Everything they do has an effect.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; Have you brought in a homeopath?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&#xA0; I tried, sir!&#xA0; I couldn't find any!</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; Excellent.&#xA0; And the Taoists?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&#xA0; They refuse to do anything!</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; Then we may yet be saved.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; What about David Chalmers?&#xA0; Shouldn't he be here?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; Chalmers... was one of the first victims.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; Oh no.</p>
<p>(<em>Cut</em> to the INTERIOR of a cell, completely walled in by reinforced glass, where DAVID CHALMERS paces back and forth.)</p>
<p>DOCTOR:&#xA0; David!&#xA0; David Chalmers!&#xA0; Can you hear me?</p>
<p>CHALMERS:&#xA0; Yes.</p>
<p>NURSE:&#xA0; It's no use, doctor.</p>
<p>CHALMERS:&#xA0; I'm perfectly fine.&#xA0; I've been introspecting on my consciousness, and I can't detect any difference.&#xA0; I <em>know</em> I would be expected to say that, but -</p>
<p>The DOCTOR turns away from the glass screen in horror.</p>
<p>DOCTOR:&#xA0; His words, they... they <em>don't mean anything.</em></p>
<p>CHALMERS:&#xA0; This is a grotesque distortion of my philosophical views.&#xA0; This sort of thing can't actually happen!</p>
<p>DOCTOR:&#xA0; Why not?</p>
<p>NURSE:&#xA0; Yes, why not?</p>
<p>CHALMERS:&#xA0; Because -</p>
<p>(<em>Cut</em> to two POLICE OFFICERS, guarding a dirt road leading up to the imposing steel gate of a gigantic concrete complex.&#xA0; On their uniforms, a badge reads "BRIDGING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY".)</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&#xA0; You've got to watch out for those clever bastards.&#xA0; They look like humans.&#xA0; They can talk like humans.&#xA0; They're identical to humans on the atomic level.&#xA0; But they're not human.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&#xA0; Scumbags.</p>
<p>The huge noise of a throbbing engine echoes over the hills.&#xA0; Up rides the MAN on a white motorcycle.&#xA0; The MAN is wearing black sunglasses and a black leather business suit with a black leather tie and silver metal boots.&#xA0; His white beard flows in the wind.&#xA0; He pulls to a halt in front of the gate.</p>
<p>The OFFICERS bustle up to the motorcycle.</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&#xA0; State your business here.</p>
<p>MAN:&#xA0; Is this where you're keeping David Chalmers?

</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&#xA0; What's it to you?&#xA0; You a friend of his?</p>
<p>MAN:&#xA0; Can't say I am.&#xA0; But even zombies have rights.</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&#xA0; All right, buddy, let's see your qualia.</p>
<p>MAN:&#xA0; I don't have any.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2 suddenly pulls a gun, keeping it trained on the MAN.&#xA0; OFFICER 2:&#xA0; Aha!&#xA0; A zombie!</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&#xA0; No, zombies claim to have qualia.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&#xA0; So he's an ordinary human?</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&#xA0; No, they also claim to have qualia.</p>
<p>The OFFICERS look at the MAN, who waits calmly.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&#xA0; Um...</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&#xA0; Who <em>are</em> you?</p>
<p>MAN:&#xA0; I'm Daniel Dennett, bitches.</p>
<p>Seemingly from nowhere, DENNETT pulls a sword and slices OFFICER 2's gun in half with a steely noise.&#xA0; OFFICER 1 begins to reach for his own gun, but DENNETT is suddenly standing behind OFFICER 1 and chops with a fist, striking the junction of OFFICER 1's shoulder and neck.&#xA0; OFFICER 1 drops to the ground.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2 steps back, horrified.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&#xA0; That's not possible!&#xA0; How'd you do that?</p>
<p>
DENNETT:&#xA0; I am one with my body.</p>
<p>DENNETT drops OFFICER 2 with another blow, and strides toward the gate.&#xA0; He looks up at the imposing concrete complex, and grips his sword tighter.</p>
<p>DENNETT <em>(quietly to himself)</em>:&#xA0; There is a spoon.</p>
<p>(<em>Cut</em> back to GENERAL FRED and the other military officials.)</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; I've just received the reports.&#xA0; We've lost Detroit.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&#xA0; I don't want to be the one to say "Good riddance", but -</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; Australia has been... <em>reduced to atoms.</em></p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; The epiphenomenal virus is spreading faster.&#xA0; Civilization itself threatens to dissolve into total normality.&#xA0; We could be looking at the middle of humanity.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&#xA0; Can we negotiate with the zombies?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; We've sent them messages.&#xA0; They sent only a single reply.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&#xA0; Which was...?</p>
<p dragover="true">GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; It's on its way now.</p>
<p>An orderly brings in an envelope, and hands it to GENERAL FRED.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED opens the envelope, takes out a single sheet of paper, and reads it.</p>
<p>Silence envelops the room.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&#xA0; What's it say?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&#xA0; It says... that <em>we're</em> the ones with the virus.</p>
<p>(A silence falls.)</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD raises his hands and stares at them.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; My God, it's true.&#xA0; It's true.&#xA0; I...</p>
<p>(A tear rolls down COLONEL TODD's cheek.)</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&#xA0; I don't feel anything.</p>
<p>The screen goes black.</p>
<p>The sound goes silent.</p>
<p>The movie continues exactly as before. </p>

PS:&#xA0; This is me being attacked by zombie nurses at Penguicon.</p>
<p>Only at a <em>combination </em>science fiction and open-source convention would it be possible to attend a session on knife-throwing, cry "In the name of Bayes, die!", throw the knife, and then have a fellow holding a wooden shield say, "Yes, but how do you determine the prior for where the knife hits?"</p></div></div></div>
