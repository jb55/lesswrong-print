<p><a href="/static/imported/2007/08/10/monsterwithgirl_2.jpg"><img src="/static/imported/2007/08/10/monsterwithgirl_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px; float: left; width: 200px; height: 267px;" border="0" alt="Monsterwithgirl_2" title="Monsterwithgirl_2"></a>In the dawn days of science fiction, alien invaders would occasionally kidnap a girl in a torn dress and carry her off for intended ravishing, as lovingly depicted on many ancient magazine covers.&#xA0; Oddly enough, the aliens never go after men in torn shirts.</p>
<p>Would a non-humanoid alien, with a different evolutionary history and <a href="/lw/l1/evolutionary_psychology/">evolutionary psychology</a>, sexually desire a human female?&#xA0; It seems rather unlikely.&#xA0; To put it mildly.</p>
<p>People don't make mistakes like that by deliberately reasoning:&#xA0; "All possible minds are likely to be wired pretty much the same way, therefore a bug-eyed monster will find human females attractive."&#xA0; Probably the artist did not even think to ask whether an alien <em>perceives</em> human females as attractive.&#xA0; Instead, a human female in a torn dress <em>is sexy</em> - inherently so, as an intrinsic property.</p>
<p>They who went astray did not think about the alien's evolutionary history; they focused on the woman's torn dress.&#xA0; If the dress were not torn, the woman would be less sexy; the alien monster doesn't enter into it.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Apparently we instinctively represent Sexiness as a direct attribute of the Woman object, <tt>Woman.sexiness</tt>, like <tt>Woman.height</tt> or <tt>Woman.weight</tt>.</p>
<p>If your brain uses that data structure, or something metaphorically similar to it, then <a href="/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/">from the inside</a> it feels like sexiness is an inherent property of the woman, not a property of the alien looking at the woman.&#xA0; Since the woman <em>is attractive,</em> the alien monster will be <em>attracted</em> to her - isn't that logical?</p>
<p>E. T. Jaynes used the term <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/6330.html">Mind Projection Fallacy</a> to denote the error of projecting your own mind's properties into the external world.&#xA0; Jaynes, as a late grand master of the Bayesian Conspiracy, was most concerned with the mistreatment of <em>probabilities </em>as inherent properties of objects, rather than states of partial knowledge in some particular mind.&#xA0; More about this shortly.</p>
<p>But the Mind Projection Fallacy generalizes as an error.&#xA0; It is in the argument over <a href="/lw/np/disputing_definitions/">the real meaning of the word sound</a>, and in the magazine cover of the monster carrying off a woman in the torn dress, and Kant's declaration that space by its very nature is flat, and Hume's definition of <a href="/lw/k2/a_priori/">a priori</a> ideas as those "discoverable by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe"...</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I once read an SF story about a human male who entered into a sexual relationship with a sentient alien plant of appropriately squishy fronds; discovered that it was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_sexuality">androecious</a> (male) plant; agonized about this for a bit; and finally decided that it didn't really matter at that point.&#xA0; And in Foglio and Pollotta's <em>Illegal Aliens,</em> the humans land on a planet inhabited by sentient insects, and see a movie advertisement showing a human carrying off a bug in a delicate chiffon dress.&#xA0; Just thought I'd mention that.)</p></div></div></div>
