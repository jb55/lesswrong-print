<p>As our tribe wanders through the grasslands, searching for fruit trees and prey, it happens every now and then that water pours down from the sky.</p>
<p>"Why does water sometimes fall from the sky?" I ask the bearded wise man of our tribe.</p>
<p>He thinks for a moment, this question having never occurred to him before, and then says, "From time to time, the sky spirits battle, and when they do, their blood drips from the sky."</p>
<p>"Where do the sky spirits come from?" I ask.</p>
<p>His voice drops to a whisper.&#xA0; "From the before time.&#xA0; From the long long ago."</p>
<p>When it rains, and you don't know why, you have several options.&#xA0; First, you could simply not ask why - not follow up on the question, or never think of the question in the first place.&#xA0; This is the <u>I</u>gnore command, which the bearded wise man originally selected.&#xA0; Second, you could try to devise some sort of explanation, the <u>E</u>xplain command, as the bearded man did in response to your first question.&#xA0; Third, you could enjoy the sensation of mysteriousness - the <u>W</u>orship command.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Now, as you are bound to notice from this story, each time you select <u>E</u>xplain, the best-case scenario is that you get an explanation, such as "sky spirits".&#xA0; But then this explanation itself is subject to the same dilemma - <u>E</u>xplain, <u>W</u>orship, or <u>I</u>gnore?&#xA0; Each time you hit <u>E</u>xplain, science grinds for a while, returns an explanation, and then another dialog box pops up.&#xA0; As good rationalists, we feel duty-bound to keep hitting <u>E</u>xplain, but it seems like a road that has no end.</p>
<p>You hit <u>E</u>xplain for life, and get chemistry; you hit <u>E</u>xplain for chemistry, and get atoms; you hit <u>E</u>xplain for atoms, and get electrons and nuclei; you hit <u>E</u>xplain for nuclei, and get quantum chromodynamics and quarks; you hit <u>E</u>xplain for how the quarks got there, and get back the Big Bang...</p>
<p>We can hit <u>E</u>xplain for the Big Bang, and wait while science grinds through its process, and maybe someday it will return a perfectly good explanation.&#xA0; But then that will just bring up another dialog box.&#xA0; So, if we continue long enough, we must come to a <em>special</em> dialog box, a <em>new</em> option, an Explanation That Needs No Explanation, a place where the chain ends - and this, maybe, is the only explanation worth knowing.</p>
<p>There - I just hit <u>W</u>orship.</p>
<p>Never forget that there are many more ways to worship something than lighting candles around an altar.</p>
<p>If I'd said, "Huh, that does seem paradoxical.&#xA0; I wonder how the apparent paradox is resolved?" then I would have hit <u>E</u>xplain, which does sometimes take a while to produce an answer.</p>
<p>And if the whole issue seems to you unimportant, or irrelevant, or if you'd rather put off thinking about it until tomorrow, than you have hit <u>I</u>gnore.</p>
<p>Select your option wisely.</p></div></div></div>
