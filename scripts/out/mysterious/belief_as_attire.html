  <div><p>I have so far distinguished between belief as <a href="/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/">anticipation-controller</a>, <a href="/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/">belief in belief</a>, <a href="/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/">professing and cheering</a>.&#xA0; Of these, we might call anticipation-controlling beliefs "proper beliefs" and the other forms "improper belief".&#xA0; A proper belief can be wrong or irrational, e.g., someone who genuinely anticipates that prayer will cure her sick baby, but the other forms are arguably "not belief at all".</p>
<p>Yet another form of improper belief is belief as group-identification - as a way of belonging.&#xA0; Robin Hanson uses the excellent <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/professing-and-.html#comment-78160476">metaphor</a> of wearing unusual clothing, a group uniform like a priest's vestments or a Jewish skullcap, and so I will call this "belief as attire".</p>
<p>In terms of <a href="/lw/i0/are_your_enemies_innately_evil/">humanly realistic psychology</a>, the Muslims who flew planes into the World Trade Center undoubtedly saw themselves as heroes defending truth, justice, and the Islamic Way from hideous alien monsters a la the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/">Independence Day</a>.&#xA0; Only a very inexperienced nerd, the sort of nerd who has no idea how non-nerds see the world, would say this out loud in an Alabama bar.&#xA0; It is not an American thing to say.&#xA0; The American thing to say is that the terrorists "hate our freedom" and that flying a plane into a building is a "cowardly act".&#xA0; You cannot say the phrases "heroic self-sacrifice" and "suicide bomber" in the same sentence, even for the sake of accurately describing how the Enemy sees the world.&#xA0; &#xA0;The very <em>concept</em> of the courage and altruism of a suicide bomber is Enemy attire - you can tell, because the Enemy talks about it.&#xA0; The cowardice and sociopathy of a suicide bomber is American attire.&#xA0; There are no quote marks you can use to talk about how the Enemy sees the world; it would be like dressing up as a Nazi for Halloween.</p>

<p>Belief-as-attire may help explain how people can be <em>passionate</em> about improper beliefs.&#xA0; Mere <a href="/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/">belief in belief</a>, or <a href="/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/">religious professing</a>, would have some trouble creating genuine, deep, powerful emotional effects.&#xA0; Or so I suspect; I confess I'm not an expert here.&#xA0; But my impression is this:&#xA0; People who've stopped anticipating-as-if their religion is true, will go to great lengths to <em>convince</em> themselves they are passionate, and this desperation can be mistaken for passion.&#xA0; But it's not the same fire they had as a child.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is very easy for a human being to genuinely, passionately, gut-level belong to a group, to cheer for<a href="/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/"> their favorite sports team</a>.&#xA0; (This is the foundation on which rests the swindle of "Republicans vs. Democrats" and analogous <a href="/lw/hu/the_third_alternative/">false dilemmas</a> in other countries, but that's a topic for another post.)&#xA0; Identifying with a tribe is a very strong emotional force.&#xA0; People will die for it.&#xA0; And once you get people to identify with a tribe, the beliefs which are attire of that tribe will be spoken with the full passion of belonging to that tribe.</p></div></div></div>
