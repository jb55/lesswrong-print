<p>Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld, a priest who heard the confessions of condemned witches, wrote in 1631 the <em>Cautio Criminalis</em> ('prudence in criminal cases') in which he bitingly described the decision tree for condemning accused witches:&#xA0; If the witch had led an evil and improper life, she
was guilty; if she had led a good and proper life, this too was a
proof, for witches dissemble and try to appear especially virtuous.
After the woman was put in prison: if she was afraid, this proved her
guilt; if she was not afraid, this proved her guilt, for witches
characteristically pretend innocence and wear a bold front. Or on
hearing of a denunciation of witchcraft against her, she might seek
flight or remain; if she ran, that proved her guilt; if she remained,
the devil had detained her so she could not get away.</p>
<p>Spee
acted as confessor to many witches; he was thus in a position to
observe <em>every</em> branch of the accusation tree, that no matter <em>what</em>
the accused witch said or did, it was held a proof against her.&#xA0; In any
individual case, you would only hear one branch of the dilemma.&#xA0; It is for this reason that scientists write down their experimental predictions in advance.</p>
<p>But <em>you can't have it both ways</em> - as a matter of probability theory, not mere fairness.&#xA0; The rule that "<a href="/lw/ih/absence_of_evidence_is_evidence_of_absence/">absence of evidence <em>is</em> evidence of absence</a>" is a special
case of a more general law, which I would name Conservation of Expected Evidence:&#xA0; The <em>expectation</em> of the posterior probability, after viewing the evidence, must equal the prior probability.</p><blockquote><p><strong>P(H) = P(H)</strong><strong><br>P(H) = P(H,E) + P(H,~E)</strong><strong><br>P(H) = P(H|E)*P(E) + P(H|~E)*P(~E)</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Therefore,</em> for every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and opposite expectation of counterevidence. </p>
<a id="more"></a><p>If you expect a strong probability of seeing weak evidence in one
direction, it must be balanced by a weak expectation of seeing strong
evidence in the other direction.&#xA0; If you're very confident in your
theory, and therefore anticipate seeing an outcome that matches your
hypothesis, this can only provide a very small increment to your belief
(it is already close to 1); but the unexpected failure of your
prediction would (and must) deal your confidence a huge blow.&#xA0; On <em>average,</em> you must expect to be <em>exactly</em> as confident as when you started out.&#xA0; Equivalently, the mere <em>expectation</em> of encountering evidence - before you've actually seen it - should not shift your prior beliefs.&#xA0; (Again, if this is not intuitively obvious, see <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html">An Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning</a>.)

<p dragover="true">So if you <a href="/lw/ih/absence_of_evidence_is_evidence_of_absence/">claim</a> that "no sabotage" is evidence <em>for </em>the existence of a Japanese-American Fifth Column, you must conversely hold that seeing sabotage would argue <em>against</em>
a Fifth Column.&#xA0; If you claim that "a good and proper life" is evidence
that a woman is a witch, then an evil and improper life must be
evidence that she is not a witch.&#xA0; If you <a href="/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/">argue</a> that God, to test
humanity's faith, refuses to reveal
His existence, then the miracles described in the Bible must argue
against the existence of God.</p>
<p dragover="true">Doesn't quite sound right, does it?&#xA0; Pay attention to that feeling of <em>this seems a little forced,</em> that <a href="/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/">quiet strain in the back of your mind</a>.&#xA0; It's important.</p>
<p dragover="true">For a true Bayesian, it is impossible to seek evidence that <em>confirms</em>
a theory.&#xA0; There is no possible plan you can devise, no clever
strategy, no cunning device, by which you can legitimately expect your
confidence in a fixed proposition to be higher (on <em>average</em>) than before.&#xA0; You can only ever seek evidence to <em>test</em> a theory, not to confirm it.</p>
<p dragover="true">This realization can take quite a load off your mind.&#xA0; You need not
worry about how to interpret every possible experimental result to
confirm your theory.&#xA0; You needn't bother planning how to make <em>any</em>
given iota of evidence confirm your theory, because you know that for
every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and oppositive
expectation of counterevidence.&#xA0; If you try to weaken the
counterevidence of a possible "abnormal" observation, you can only do it by
weakening the support of a "normal" observation, to a precisely equal
and opposite degree.&#xA0; It is a zero-sum game.&#xA0; No matter how you connive, no matter how you argue, no matter how you strategize, you can't possibly expect the resulting game plan to shift your beliefs (on average) in a
particular direction.</p>
<p dragover="true">You might as well
sit back and relax while you wait for the evidence to come in.</p>
<p dragover="true">...human psychology is <em>so</em> screwed up.</p></div></div></div>
