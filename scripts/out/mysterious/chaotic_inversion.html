  <div><p>I was recently having a conversation with some friends on the topic of hour-by-hour productivity and willpower maintenance - something I've struggled with my whole life.</p>
<p>I can <a href="/lw/un/on_doing_the_impossible/">avoid running away from a hard problem the first time I see it</a> (perseverance on a timescale of seconds), and I can stick to the same problem for years; but to keep working on a timescale of <em>hours</em> is a constant battle for me.&#xA0; It goes without saying that I've already read reams and reams of advice; and the most help I got from it was realizing that a sizable fraction other creative professionals had the same problem, and couldn't beat it either, no matter how reasonable<em>&#xA0;</em>all the advice sounds.</p>
<p>"What do you do when you can't work?" my friends asked me.&#xA0; (Conversation probably not accurate, this is a very loose gist.)</p>
<p>And I replied that I usually browse random websites, or watch a short video.</p>
<p>"Well," they said, "if you know you can't work for a while, you should watch a movie or something."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," I replied, "I have to do something whose time comes in short units, like browsing the Web or watching short videos, because I might become able to work again at any time, and I can't predict when -"</p>
<p>And then I stopped, because I'd just had a revelation.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>I'd always thought of my workcycle as something <em>chaotic,</em> something <em>unpredictable.</em>&#xA0; I never used those words, but that was the way I <em>treated</em> it.</p>
<p>But here my friends seemed to be implying - what a strange thought - that <em>other</em> people could predict when they would become able to work again, and structure their time accordingly.</p>
<p>And it occurred to me for the first time that I might have been committing that damned old chestnut the <a href="/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/">Mind Projection Fallacy</a>, right out there in my ordinary everyday life instead of high abstraction.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn't that my productivity was<em> unusually </em><em>chaotic;</em> maybe I was just<em> unusually </em><em>stupid</em> with respect to predicting it.</p>
<p>That's what inverted stupidity looks like - chaos.&#xA0; Something hard to handle, hard to grasp, hard to guess, something you can't do anything with.&#xA0; It's not just an idiom for high abstract things like Artificial Intelligence.&#xA0; It can apply in ordinary life too.</p>
<p>And the reason we don't think of the alternative explanation "I'm stupid", is <em>not</em> - I suspect - that we think so highly of ourselves.&#xA0; It's just that we don't think of ourselves at all.&#xA0; We just see <a href="/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/">a chaotic feature of the environment</a>.</p>
<p>So now it's occurred to me that my productivity problem may not be chaos, but my own stupidity.</p>
<p>And that may or may not help anything.&#xA0; It certainly doesn't fix the problem right away.&#xA0; Saying "I'm ignorant" doesn't make you knowledgeable.</p>
<p>But it is, at least, a different path than saying "it's too chaotic".</p></div></div></div>
