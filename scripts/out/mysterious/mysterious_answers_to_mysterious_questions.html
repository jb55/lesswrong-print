  <div><p>Imagine looking at your hand, and knowing nothing of cells,
nothing of biochemistry, nothing of DNA. You've learned some anatomy from
dissection, so you know your hand contains muscles; but you don't know why
muscles move instead of lying there like clay. Your hand is just... stuff...
and for some reason it moves under your direction. Is this not magic? </p>
<blockquote><p>"The animal body does not act
as a thermodynamic engine ... consciousness teaches every individual that they
are, to some extent, subject to the direction of his will. It appears therefore
that animated creatures have the power of immediately applying to certain
moving particles of matter within their bodies, forces by which the motions of
these particles are directed to produce derived mechanical effects... The
influence of animal or vegetable life on matter is infinitely beyond the range
of any scientific inquiry hitherto entered on. Its power of directing the
motions of moving particles, in the demonstrated daily miracle of our human
free-will, and in the growth of generation after generation of plants from a
single seed, are infinitely different from any possible result of the
fortuitous concurrence of atoms... Modern biologists were coming once more to
the acceptance of something and that was a vital principle."<br>&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; -- Lord Kelvin </p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was the theory of <em>vitalism</em>; that the mysterious difference
between living matter and non-living matter was explained by an <em>elan vital</em>
or <em>vis vitalis</em>.&#xA0; Elan vital
infused living matter and caused it to move as consciously directed. Elan vital
participated in chemical transformations which no mere non-living particles
could undergo - W&#xE23;&#xE16;hler's later synthesis of urea, a component of urine,
was a major blow to the vitalistic theory because it showed that mere<em>
chemistry</em> could duplicate a product of biology.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Calling "elan vital" an explanation, even a <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-explanatio.html">fake explanation</a> like <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-causality.html">phlogiston</a>, is probably giving it too much credit.&#xA0; It functioned primarily as a <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/semantic-stopsi.html">curiosity-stopper</a>.&#xA0; You said "Why?" and the answer was "Elan vital!"</p><a id="more"></a><p class="MsoNormal">When you say "Elan vital!", it <em>feels</em>
like you know why your hand moves.&#xA0; You have a little <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-causality.html">causal diagram</a> in
your head that says
["Elan vital!"] -&gt; [hand moves].&#xA0; But actually you know nothing
you didn't know before. You don't know, say, whether your hand will
generate heat or absorb heat,
unless you have observed the fact already; if not, you won't be able to
predict it in advance.&#xA0; Your curiosity feels sated, but it hasn't been fed.&#xA0; Since you can say "Why? Elan vital!" to any
possible observation, it is equally good at explaining all outcomes, a
disguised hypothesis of maximum entropy, etcetera.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the greater lesson lies in the vitalists' reverence for
the elan vital, their eagerness to pronounce it a mystery beyond all science.
Meeting the great dragon Unknown, the vitalists did not draw their swords to do
battle, but bowed their necks in submission. They <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/03/tsuyoku_naritai.html">took pride</a> in their ignorance,
made biology into a <em>sacred</em> mystery,
and thereby became loath to <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/virtues/">relinquish their ignorance</a> when evidence
came knocking.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Secret of Life was <em>infinitely
beyond the reach of science!</em> Not
just a <em>little</em> beyond, mind you, but <em>infinitely</em> beyond! Lord Kelvin sure did get a tremendous
emotional kick out of <em>not knowing
something.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But ignorance exists in
the map, not in the territory.&#xA0; If I am ignorant about a phenomenon, that is a fact
about my own state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon itself. A phenomenon can <em>seem</em> mysterious to some particular person.&#xA0; There are no phenomena
which are mysterious of themselves. To
worship a phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully mysterious, is to worship your own
ignorance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Vitalism shared with phlogiston the error of <em>encapsulating
the mystery as a substance.</em> Fire was mysterious, and the phlogiston theory
encapsulated the mystery in a mysterious substance called
"phlogiston". Life was a sacred mystery, and vitalism encapsulated
the sacred mystery in a mysterious substance called "elan vital".
Neither answer helped <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/focus-your-unce.html">concentrate the model's probability
density</a> - make some outcomes easier to explain than others. The "explanation" just wrapped up the question as a small,
hard, opaque black ball.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a comedy written by Moliere, a physician
explains the power of a soporific by saying that it contains a
"dormitive potency".&#xA0; Same principle.&#xA0; It is a failure of human psychology that, faced with a
mysterious phenomenon, we more readily postulate mysterious inherent substances
than complex underlying processes. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the deeper failure is supposing that an <em>answer</em>
can be mysterious. If a
phenomenon feels mysterious, that is a fact about our state of knowledge, not a
fact about the phenomenon itself. The vitalists saw a mysterious gap in their
knowledge, and postulated a mysterious stuff that plugged the gap. In doing so, they mixed
up the map with the territory. All confusion and bewilderment exist in the
mind, not in encapsulated substances.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is the ultimate and fully general explanation
for why, again and again in humanity's history, people are shocked to
discover that an incredibly mysterious question has a non-mysterious
answer.&#xA0; Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Therefore I call theories such as vitalism <em>mysterious
answers to mysterious questions</em>.</p>
<p>These are the signs of mysterious answers to mysterious
questions:</p>
<ul><li>First, the explanation acts as a <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/semantic-stopsi.html">curiosity-stopper</a> rather than an <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/making-beliefs-.html">anticipation-controller</a>.</li>
<li>Second, the hypothesis has no moving parts - the model is not a specific complex mechanism, but a blankly solid substance or force. The mysterious substance or mysterious force may be said to be here or there, to <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-causality.html">cause </a>this or that; but the reason why the mysterious force behaves thus is wrapped in a blank unity.</li>
<li>Third, those who proffer the explanation <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/virtues/">cherish their ignorance</a>; they speak proudly of how the phenomenon defeats ordinary science or is unlike merely mundane phenomena.</li>
<li>Fourth, <em>even after the answer is given, the phenomenon is still a mystery </em>and possesses the same quality of wonderful inexplicability that it had at the start. </li></ul>
