  <div><p><strong>Followup to:</strong>&#xA0; <a href="/lw/ip/fake_explanations/">Fake Explanations</a></p>
<p>When I was young, I read popular physics books such as Richard Feynman's <em>QED: The <a href="/lw/hs/think_like_reality/">Strange</a> Theory of Light and Matter.</em>&#xA0; I knew that light was waves, sound was waves, matter was waves.&#xA0; I took pride in my scientific literacy, when I was nine years old.</p>
<p>When I was older, and I began to read the <em>Feynman Lectures on Physics,</em> I ran across a gem called "the wave equation".&#xA0; I could follow the equation's derivation, but, <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/polya.html">looking back</a>, I couldn't see its truth at a glance.&#xA0; So I thought about the wave equation for three days, on and off, until I saw that it was embarrassingly obvious.&#xA0; And when I finally understood, I realized that the whole time I had accepted the honest assurance of physicists that light was waves, sound was waves, matter was waves, I had not had the vaguest idea of what the word "wave" meant to a physicist.</p>
<p>There is an instinctive tendency to think that if a physicist says "light is made of waves", and the teacher says "What is light made of?", and the student says "Waves!", the student has made a true statement.&#xA0; That's only fair, right?&#xA0; We accept "waves" as a correct answer from the physicist; wouldn't it be unfair to reject it from the student?&#xA0; Surely, the answer "Waves!" is either <em>true</em> or <em>false,</em> right?<em>&#xA0;</em></p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Which is one more bad habit to <a href="/lw/i2/two_more_things_to_unlearn_from_school/">unlearn from school</a>. Words do not have intrinsic definitions. If I hear the syllables "bea-ver" and think of a large rodent, that is a fact about my own state of mind, not a fact about the syllables "bea-ver".&#xA0; The sequence of syllables "made of waves" (or "<a href="/lw/ip/fake_explanations/">because of heat conduction</a>") is not a <em>hypothesis,</em> it is a pattern of vibrations traveling through the air, or ink on paper.&#xA0; It can <em>associate</em> to a hypothesis in someone's mind, but it is not, of itself, right or wrong.&#xA0; But in school, the teacher hands you a gold star for <em>saying</em> "made of waves", which must be the correct answer because the teacher heard a physicist emit the same sound-vibrations.&#xA0; Since verbal behavior (spoken or written) is what gets the gold star, students begin to think that verbal behavior has a truth-value.&#xA0; After all, either light is made of waves, or it isn't, right?</p>
<p>And this leads into an even worse habit.&#xA0; Suppose the teacher presents you with a <a href="/lw/ip/fake_explanations/">confusing problem</a> involving a metal plate next to a radiator; the far side feels warmer than the side next to the radiator.&#xA0; The teacher asks "Why?"&#xA0; If you say "I don't know", you have <em>no</em> chance of getting a gold star - it won't even count as class participation.&#xA0; But, during the current semester, this teacher has used the phrases "because of heat convection", "because of heat conduction", and "because of radiant heat".&#xA0; One of these is probably what the teacher wants.&#xA0; You say, "Eh, maybe because of heat conduction?"</p>
<p>This is not a<em>&#xA0;</em>hypothesis <em>about </em>the metal plate.&#xA0; This is not even a <a href="/lw/i7/belief_as_attire/">proper belief</a>.&#xA0; It is an attempt to <em>guess the teacher's password.</em></p>
<p>Even visualizing the symbols of the diffusion equation (the math governing heat conduction) doesn't mean you've formed a hypothesis <em>about</em> the metal plate.&#xA0; This is not school; we are not testing your memory to see if you can write down the diffusion equation.&#xA0; This is Bayescraft; we are scoring your anticipations of experience.&#xA0; If you <em>use</em> the diffusion equation, by measuring a few points with a thermometer and then trying to predict what the thermometer will say on the next measurement, then it is definitely connected to experience.&#xA0; Even if the student just visualizes something <em>flowing,</em> and therefore holds a match near the cooler side of the plate to try to measure where the heat goes, then this mental image of flowing-ness connects to experience; it controls anticipation.</p>
<p>If you aren't <em>using</em> the diffusion equation - putting in numbers and getting out results that control your anticipation of particular experiences - then the connection between map and territory is severed as though by a knife.&#xA0; What remains <a href="/lw/i7/belief_as_attire/">is not a belief</a>, but a verbal behavior.<br><br>In the school system, it's all about verbal behavior, whether written on paper or spoken aloud.&#xA0; Verbal behavior gets you a gold star or a failing grade.&#xA0; Part of unlearning this bad habit is becoming consciously aware of the difference between an explanation and a password.</p>
<p>Does this seem too harsh?&#xA0; When you're faced by a confusing metal plate, can't "Heat conduction?" be a first step toward finding the answer?&#xA0; Maybe, but only if you don't fall into the trap of thinking that you are looking for a password.&#xA0; What if there is no teacher to tell you that you failed?&#xA0; Then you may think that "Light is wakalixes" is a good explanation, that "wakalixes" is the correct password.&#xA0; It happened to me when I was nine years old - not because I was stupid, but because this is what happens <em>by default.</em><em>&#xA0;</em>This is how human beings think, unless they are trained <em>not</em> to fall into the trap.&#xA0; Humanity stayed stuck in holes like this for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Maybe, if we drill students that <em>words don't count, only anticipation-controllers,</em> the student will <em>not</em> get stuck on "Heat conduction? No?&#xA0; Maybe heat convection?&#xA0; That's not it either?"&#xA0; Maybe <em>then,</em> thinking the phrase "Heat conduction" will lead onto a genuinely helpful path, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Heat conduction?"</li>
<li>But that's only a phrase - what does it mean?</li>
<li>The diffusion equation?</li>
<li>But those are only symbols - how do I apply them?</li>
<li>What does applying the diffusion equation lead me to anticipate?</li>
<li>It sure doesn't lead me to anticipate that the side of a metal plate farther away from a radiator would feel warmer.</li>
<li>I <a href="/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/">notice</a> that I am <a href="/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/">confused</a>.&#xA0; Maybe the near side just <em>feels</em> cooler, because it's made of more insulative material and transfers less heat to my hand?&#xA0; I'll try measuring the temperature...</li>
<li>Okay, that wasn't it.&#xA0; Can I try to verify whether the diffusion equation holds true of this metal plate, at all?&#xA0; Is heat <em>flowing</em> the way it usually does, or is something else going on?</li>
<li>I could hold a match to the plate and try to measure how heat spreads over time...</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are <em>not</em> strict about "Eh, maybe because of heat conduction?" being a fake explanation, the student will very probably get stuck on some wakalixes-password.&#xA0; <em>This happens by default, it happened to the whole human species for thousands of years.</em></p>
