# Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions

Imagine looking at your hand, and knowing nothing of cells, nothing
of biochemistry, nothing of DNA. You've learned some anatomy from
dissection, so you know your hand contains muscles; but you don't
know why muscles move instead of lying there like clay. Your hand
is just... stuff... and for some reason it moves under your
direction. Is this not magic?

This was the theory of *vitalism*; that the mysterious difference
between living matter and non-living matter was explained by an
*elan vital* or *vis vitalis*.  Elan vital infused living matter
and caused it to move as consciously directed. Elan vital
participated in chemical transformations which no mere non-living
particles could undergo - Wรถhler's later synthesis of urea, a
component of urine, was a major blow to the vitalistic theory
because it showed that mere*chemistry* could duplicate a product of
biology.

Calling "elan vital" an explanation, even a
[fake explanation](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-explanatio.html)
like
[phlogiston](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-causality.html),
is probably giving it too much credit.  It functioned primarily as
a
[curiosity-stopper](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/semantic-stopsi.html). 
You said "Why?" and the answer was "Elan vital!"

When you say "Elan vital!", it *feels* like you know why your hand
moves.  You have a little
[causal diagram](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-causality.html)
in your head that says ["Elan vital!"] -\> [hand moves].  But
actually you know nothing you didn't know before. You don't know,
say, whether your hand will generate heat or absorb heat, unless
you have observed the fact already; if not, you won't be able to
predict it in advance.  Your curiosity feels sated, but it hasn't
been fed.  Since you can say "Why? Elan vital!" to any possible
observation, it is equally good at explaining all outcomes, a
disguised hypothesis of maximum entropy, etcetera.

But the greater lesson lies in the vitalists' reverence for the
elan vital, their eagerness to pronounce it a mystery beyond all
science. Meeting the great dragon Unknown, the vitalists did not
draw their swords to do battle, but bowed their necks in
submission. They
[took pride](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/03/tsuyoku_naritai.html)
in their ignorance, made biology into a *sacred* mystery, and
thereby became loath to
[relinquish their ignorance](http://yudkowsky.net/virtues/) when
evidence came knocking.

The Secret of Life was *infinitely beyond the reach of science!*
Not just a *little* beyond, mind you, but *infinitely* beyond! Lord
Kelvin sure did get a tremendous emotional kick out of
*not knowing something.*

But ignorance exists in the map, not in the territory.  If I am
ignorant about a phenomenon, that is a fact about my own state of
mind, not a fact about the phenomenon itself. A phenomenon can
*seem* mysterious to some particular person.  There are no
phenomena which are mysterious of themselves. To worship a
phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully mysterious, is to
worship your own ignorance.

Vitalism shared with phlogiston the error of
*encapsulating the mystery as a substance.* Fire was mysterious,
and the phlogiston theory encapsulated the mystery in a mysterious
substance called "phlogiston". Life was a sacred mystery, and
vitalism encapsulated the sacred mystery in a mysterious substance
called "elan vital". Neither answer helped
[concentrate the model's probability density](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/focus-your-unce.html)
- make some outcomes easier to explain than others. The
"explanation" just wrapped up the question as a small, hard, opaque
black ball.

In a comedy written by Moliere, a physician explains the power of a
soporific by saying that it contains a "dormitive potency".  Same
principle.  It is a failure of human psychology that, faced with a
mysterious phenomenon, we more readily postulate mysterious
inherent substances than complex underlying processes.

But the deeper failure is supposing that an *answer* can be
mysterious. If a phenomenon feels mysterious, that is a fact about
our state of knowledge, not a fact about the phenomenon itself. The
vitalists saw a mysterious gap in their knowledge, and postulated a
mysterious stuff that plugged the gap. In doing so, they mixed up
the map with the territory. All confusion and bewilderment exist in
the mind, not in encapsulated substances.

This is the ultimate and fully general explanation for why, again
and again in humanity's history, people are shocked to discover
that an incredibly mysterious question has a non-mysterious
answer.  Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.

Therefore I call theories such as vitalism
*mysterious answers to mysterious questions*.

These are the signs of mysterious answers to mysterious questions:

-   First, the explanation acts as a
    [curiosity-stopper](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/semantic-stopsi.html)
    rather than an
    [anticipation-controller](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/making-beliefs-.html).
-   Second, the hypothesis has no moving parts - the model is not a
    specific complex mechanism, but a blankly solid substance or force.
    The mysterious substance or mysterious force may be said to be here
    or there, to
    [cause](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/fake-causality.html)this
    or that; but the reason why the mysterious force behaves thus is
    wrapped in a blank unity.
-   Third, those who proffer the explanation
    [cherish their ignorance](http://yudkowsky.net/virtues/); they
    speak proudly of how the phenomenon defeats ordinary science or is
    unlike merely mundane phenomena.
-   Fourth,
    *even after the answer is given, the phenomenon is still a mystery*and
    possesses the same quality of wonderful inexplicability that it had
    at the start.
