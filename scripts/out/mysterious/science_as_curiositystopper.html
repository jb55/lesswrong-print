<p class="MsoNormal">Imagine that I, in full view of live television cameras,
raised my hands and chanted <em>abracadabra</em>
and caused a brilliant light to be born, flaring in empty space beyond my
outstretched hands.&#xA0; Imagine that I
committed this act of blatant, unmistakeable sorcery under the full supervision
of James Randi and all skeptical armies. Most people, I think, would be <em>fairly
curious</em> as to what was going on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But now suppose instead that I don't go on
television.&#xA0; I do not wish to share the power, nor the truth behind it.
I want to keep my sorcery secret.&#xA0; And yet I also want to cast my
spells whenever and wherever I please. I want to cast my
brilliant flare of light so that I can read a book on the train -
without anyone becoming curious.&#xA0; Is there a spell that stops curiosity?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yes indeed!&#xA0; Whenever anyone asks "How did you do that?", I just say "Science!"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It's <a href="/lw/ip/fake_explanations/">not a
real explanation</a>, so much as a <a href="/lw/it/semantic_stopsigns/">curiosity-stopper</a>. It doesn't tell
you whether the light will brighten or fade, change color in hue or saturation,
and it certainly doesn't tell you how to make a similar light yourself. You don't actually <em>know</em> anything more than you knew before I said the <a href="/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/">magic word</a>. But you turn away, satisfied that nothing
unusual is going on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Better yet, the same trick works with a standard light switch.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Flip a switch and a light bulb turns on.&#xA0; Why?
</p>
<p>In school, one is taught that the <a href="/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/">password</a>
to the light bulb is "Electricity!"&#xA0; By now, I hope, you're wary of marking the light bulb "understood" on such a basis.&#xA0; Does saying "Electricity!" let you do calculations that will control your anticipation of experience?&#xA0; There is, at the least, a great deal more to learn.&#xA0; (Physicists should ignore this paragraph and substitute a problem in <a href="/lw/kr/an_alien_god/">evolutionary theory</a>, where the substance of the theory is again in calculations that few people know how to perform.)</p>
<p>If you thought the light bulb was <em>scientifically
inexplicable,</em> it would seize the <em>entirety</em> of your attention.&#xA0; You would drop whatever else you were doing, and focus on that light bulb.</p>
<p>But what does the phrase "scientifically explicable" mean?&#xA0; It means that someone <em>else</em>
knows how the light bulb works.&#xA0; When you are told the light bulb is
"scientifically explicable", you don't know more than you knew earlier;
you don't know whether the light bulb will brighten or fade.&#xA0; But
because someone <em>else</em> knows, it devalues the knowledge in your eyes.&#xA0; You become less curious.</p>
<p>Since this is an econblog, someone out there is bound to say, "If
the light bulb were unknown to science, you could gain fame and fortune
by investigating it."&#xA0; But I'm not talking about greed.&#xA0; I'm not
talking about career ambition.&#xA0; I'm talking about the raw emotion of
curiosity - the feeling of being intrigued.&#xA0; Why should <em>your</em> curiosity be
diminished because someone <em>else,</em> not you, knows how the light bulb works?&#xA0; Is this not spite?&#xA0; It's not enough for <em>you</em> to know; other people must also be ignorant, or you won't be happy?</p>
<p>There are goods that knowledge may serve besides curiosity, such as
the social utility of technology.&#xA0; For these instrumental goods, it
matters whether some other entity in local space already knows.&#xA0; But
for my own curiosity, why should it matter?&#xA0; </p>
<p>Besides, consider the consequences if you permit "Someone else knows
the answer" to function as a curiosity-stopper.&#xA0; One day you walk into
your living room and see a giant green elephant, seemingly hovering in
midair, surrounded by an aura of silver light.</p>
<p>"What the heck?" you say.</p>
<p>And a voice comes from above the elephant, saying, "SOMEONE ELSE ALREADY KNOWS WHY THIS ELEPHANT IS HERE."</p>
<p> "Oh," you say, "in that case, never mind," and walk on to the kitchen.</p>
<p>I don't know the grand
unified theory for this universe's laws of physics.&#xA0; I also don't know
much about human anatomy with the exception of the brain.&#xA0; I couldn't
point out on my body where my kidneys are, and I can't recall offhand
what my liver does.&#xA0; (I am not proud of this.&#xA0; Alas, with all the math I need to study, I'm not likely
to learn anatomy anytime soon.)</p>
<p>Should I, so far as <em>curiosity</em> is concerned, be more intrigued
by my ignorance of the ultimate laws of physics, than the fact that I don't know
much about what goes on inside my own body?</p>
<p>If I raised my hands and cast a light spell, you would be intrigued.&#xA0; Should you be any <em>less</em>
intrigued by the very fact that I raised my hands?&#xA0; When you raise your
arm and wave a hand around, this act of will is
coordinated by (among other brain areas) your cerebellum.&#xA0; I bet you
don't know how the cerebellum works.&#xA0; <em>I</em> know a little - though only the gross details, not enough to perform calculations... but so what?&#xA0; What does that matter, if <em>you</em> don't know?&#xA0; Why should there be a double standard of curiosity for sorcery and hand motions?</p>
<p>Look at yourself in the mirror.&#xA0; Do you know what you're looking
at?&#xA0; Do you know what looks out from behind your eyes?&#xA0; Do you know
what you are?&#xA0; Some of that answer, Science knows, and some of it
Science does not.&#xA0; But why should that distinction matter to your
curiosity, if <em>you</em> don't know?</p>
<p>Do you know how your knees
work?&#xA0; Do you know how your shoes were made?&#xA0; Do you know why your computer
monitor glows?&#xA0; Do you know why water is wet?</p>
<p>The world around you is full of puzzles.&#xA0; Prioritize, if you
must.&#xA0; But do not complain that cruel Science has emptied the world of
mystery.&#xA0; With reasoning such as that, I could get you to overlook an
elephant in your living room.</p></div></div></div>
