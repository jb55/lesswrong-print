  <div><p>I am teaching a class, and I write upon the blackboard three numbers:&#xA0; 2-4-6.&#xA0; "I am thinking of a rule," I say, "which governs sequences of three numbers.&#xA0; The sequence 2-4-6, as it so happens, obeys this rule.&#xA0; Each of you will find, on your desk, a pile of index cards.&#xA0; Write down a sequence of three numbers on a card, and I'll mark it "Yes" for fits the rule, or "No" for not fitting the rule.&#xA0; Then you can write down another set of three numbers and ask whether it fits again, and so on.&#xA0; When you're confident that you know the rule, write down the rule on a card.&#xA0; You can test as many triplets as you like."</p>
<p>Here's the record of one student's guesses:</p>
<p>4, 6, 2&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; No<br>4, 6, 8&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; Yes<br>10, 12, 14&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;Yes</p>
<p>At this point the student wrote down his guess at the rule.&#xA0; What do <em>you</em> think the rule is?&#xA0; Would you have wanted to test another triplet, and if so, what would it be?&#xA0; Take a moment to think before continuing.</p><a id="more"></a><p>The challenge above is based on a classic experiment due to Peter Wason, the 2-4-6 task.&#xA0; Although subjects given this task typically expressed high confidence in their guesses, only 21% of the subjects successfully guessed the experimenter's real rule, and replications since then have continued to show success rates of around 20%.</p>
<p>The study was called "On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task" (<em>Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,</em> 12: 129-140, 1960).&#xA0; Subjects who attempt the 2-4-6 task usually try to generate <em>positive</em> examples, rather than <em>negative</em> examples - they apply the hypothetical rule to generate a representative instance, and see if it is labeled "Yes".</p>
<p>Thus, someone who forms the hypothesis "numbers increasing by two" will test the triplet 8-10-12, hear that it fits, and confidently announce the rule.&#xA0; Someone who forms the hypothesis X-2X-3X will test the triplet 3-6-9, discover that it fits, and then announce that rule.</p>
<p>In every case the actual rule is the same: the three numbers must be in ascending order.</p>
<p>But to discover this, you would have to generate triplets that <em>shouldn't</em> fit, such as 20-23-26, and see if they are labeled "No".&#xA0; Which people tend not to do, in this experiment.&#xA0; In some cases, subjects devise, "test", and announce rules far more complicated than the actual answer.</p>
<p>This cognitive phenomenon is usually lumped in with "confirmation bias".&#xA0; However, it seems to me that the phenomenon of trying to test <em>positive</em> rather than <em>negative</em> examples, ought to be distinguished from the phenomenon of trying to preserve the belief you started with.&#xA0; "Positive bias" is sometimes used as a synonym for "confirmation bias", and fits this particular flaw much better.</p>
<p>
It once seemed that <a href="/lw/is/fake_causality/">phlogiston theory</a>
could explain a flame going out in an enclosed box (the air became
saturated with phlogiston and no more could be released), but
phlogiston theory could just as well have explained the flame <em>not</em> going
out.&#xA0; To notice this, you have to search for negative examples instead of positive examples, look into zero instead of one; which goes against the grain of what experiment has shown to be human instinct.</p>
<p>For by instinct, we human beings only live in half the world.</p>
<p>One may be lectured on positive bias for days, and yet overlook it in-the-moment.&#xA0; Positive bias is not something we do as a matter of logic, or even as a matter of emotional attachment.&#xA0; The 2-4-6 task is "cold", logical, not affectively "hot".&#xA0; And yet the mistake is sub-verbal, on the level of imagery, of instinctive reactions.&#xA0; Because the problem doesn't arise from following a deliberate rule that says "Only think about positive examples", it can't be solved just by knowing verbally that "We ought to think about both positive and negative examples."&#xA0; Which example automatically pops into your head?&#xA0; You have to learn, wordlessly, to zag instead of zig.&#xA0; You have to learn to flinch toward the zero, instead of away from it.</p>
<p>I have been writing for quite some time now on the notion that <a href="/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/">the strength of a hypothesis is what it <em>can't</em> explain, not what it <em>can</em></a> - if you are equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge.&#xA0; So to spot an explanation that isn't helpful, it's not enough to think of what it does explain very well - you also have to search for results it <em>couldn't</em> explain, and this is the true strength of the theory.</p>
<p>So I said all this, and then yesterday, <a dragover="true" href="/lw/iv/the_futility_of_emergence/">I challenged the usefulness of "emergence" as a concept</a>.&#xA0; One commenter cited superconductivity and ferromagnetism as examples of emergence.&#xA0; I replied that non-superconductivity and non-ferromagnetism were also examples of emergence, which was the problem.&#xA0; But be it far from me to criticize the commenter!&#xA0; Despite having read extensively on "confirmation bias", I didn't spot the "gotcha" in the 2-4-6 task the first time I read about it.&#xA0; It's a subverbal blink-reaction that has to be retrained.&#xA0; I'm still working on it myself.</p>
<p>So much of a rationalist's skill is below the level of words.&#xA0; It makes for challenging work in trying to convey the Art through blog posts.&#xA0; People will agree with you, but then, in the next sentence, do something subdeliberative that goes in the opposite direction.&#xA0; Not that I'm complaining!&#xA0; A major reason I'm posting here is to observe what my words <em>haven't</em> conveyed.</p>
<p>Are you searching for positive examples of positive bias right now, or sparing a fraction of your search on what positive bias should lead you to <em>not</em> see?&#xA0; Did you look toward light or darkness?</p></div></div></div>
