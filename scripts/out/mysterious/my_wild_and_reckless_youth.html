  <div><p>It is said that parents do all the things they tell their children not to do, which is how they know not to do them.</p>
<p>Long ago, in the unthinkably distant past, I was a devoted Traditional Rationalist, conceiving myself skilled according to that kind, yet I knew not the Way of Bayes.&#xA0; When the young Eliezer was confronted with a mysterious-seeming question, the precepts of Traditional Rationality did not stop him from devising a <a href="/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/">Mysterious Answer</a>.&#xA0; It is, by far, the most embarrassing mistake I made in my life, and I still wince to think of it.</p>
<p>What was my mysterious answer to a mysterious question?&#xA0; This I will
not describe, for it would be a long tale and complicated.&#xA0; 
I was young, and a mere Traditional Rationalist who knew not the teachings of Tversky and Kahneman.&#xA0; I knew about Occam's Razor, but not the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy">conjunction fallacy</a>.&#xA0; 
I thought I could get away with thinking complicated thoughts myself, in the literary style of the complicated thoughts I read in science books, not realizing
that correct complexity is only possible when every step is pinned down
overwhelmingly.&#xA0; Today, one of the chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring young rationalists is "Do not attempt long chains of reasoning or complicated plans."</p>
<p>Nothing more than this need be said:&#xA0; Even after I invented my "answer", the phenomenon
was <a href="/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/">still a mystery</a> unto me, and possessed the same quality of wondrous
impenetrability that it had at the start.</p>
<p>Make
no <a href="/lw/hz/correspondence_bias/">mistake</a>, that younger Eliezer was not stupid.&#xA0; All the errors of which the young Eliezer
was guilty, are still being made today by respected scientists in respected journals.&#xA0; It would have
taken a subtler skill to protect him, than ever he was taught as a
Traditional Rationalist.</p>
<p>Indeed, the young Eliezer diligently and painstakingly followed the injunctions of Traditional Rationality in the course of going astray.</p><a id="more"></a><p>
As a Traditional Rationalist, the young Eliezer was careful to
ensure that his Mysterious Answer made a bold prediction of future
experience.&#xA0; Namely, I expected future neurologists to discover that
neurons were exploiting quantum gravity, a la Sir Roger Penrose.&#xA0; This required neurons to maintain a certain degree of quantum coherence, which was something you could look for, and find or not find.&#xA0; Either you observe that or you don't, right?</p>
<p>But my hypothesis made
no <em>retrospective</em> predictions.&#xA0; According to Traditional Science, retrospective
predictions don't count - so why bother making them?&#xA0; To a Bayesian, on the other hand,
if a hypothesis does not <em>today</em> have a favorable likelihood ratio over "I don't know", it raises the question of why you <em>today</em> believe anything more complicated than "I don't know".&#xA0; But I knew not the Way of Bayes, so I was not thinking about likelihood ratios or focusing probability density.&#xA0; I had Made a Falsifiable Prediction; was this not the Law?</p>
<p>As a Traditional Rationalist, the young Eliezer was careful not to
believe in magic, mysticism, carbon chauvinism, or anything of that sort.&#xA0; I proudly <a href="/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/">professed</a>
of my Mysterious Answer, "It is just physics like all the rest of
physics!"&#xA0; As if you could save magic from being a cognitive isomorph
of magic, by <a href="/lw/ir/science_as_attire/">calling</a> it quantum gravity.&#xA0; But I knew not the Way of Bayes, and did not see the <a href="/lw/ip/fake_explanations/">level</a> on which my idea was isomorphic to magic.&#xA0; I gave my <em>allegiance</em> to physics, but this did not save me; what does probability theory know of allegiances?&#xA0; I avoided everything that Traditional Rationality told me was forbidden, but what was left was still magic.</p>
<p>Beyond a doubt, my allegiance to Traditional Rationality helped me get out of the hole I dug myself into.&#xA0; If I hadn't been a Traditional Rationalist, I would have been <em>completely</em> screwed.&#xA0; But Traditional Rationality still wasn't enough to get it <em>right.</em>&#xA0; It just led me into different mistakes than the ones it had explicitly forbidden.</p>
<p>When I think about how my younger self very carefully followed the rules of Traditional Rationality in the course of getting the answer <em>wrong,</em> it sheds light on the question of why people who call themselves "rationalists" <a href="/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/">do not rule the world</a>.&#xA0; You need <em>one whole hell of a lot</em> of rationality before it does anything but lead you into new and interesting mistakes.<em>&#xA0;</em></p>
<p>Traditional Rationality is taught as an art, rather than a science; you read the biography of famous physicists describing the lessons life taught them, and you try to do what they tell you to do.&#xA0; But you haven't lived their lives, and half of what they're trying to describe is an instinct that has been trained into them.

</p>
<p>The way Traditional Rationality is designed, it would have been
acceptable for me to spend 30 years on my silly idea, so long as I
succeeded in falsifying it eventually, and was honest with myself about
what my theory predicted, and accepted the disproof when it arrived, et
cetera.&#xA0; This is enough to let the Ratchet of Science click forward,
but it's a little harsh on the people who waste 30 years of their
lives.&#xA0; Traditional Rationality is a walk, not a dance.&#xA0; It's designed
to get you to the truth <em>eventually</em>, and gives you all too much time to smell the flowers along the way.</p>
<p dragover="true">Traditional Rationalists can agree to disagree.&#xA0; Traditional Rationality doesn't have the <em>ideal</em> that thinking is an exact art in which there is only one correct probability estimate given the evidence.&#xA0; In Traditional Rationality, you're allowed to guess, and then test your guess.&#xA0; But experience has taught me that if you don't <em>know,</em> and you guess, you'll end up being wrong.</p><p>The Way of Bayes is also an imprecise art, at least the way I'm holding forth upon it.&#xA0; These blog posts are still fumbling attempts to put into words lessons that would be better taught by experience.&#xA0; But at least there's <em>underlying</em> math, plus experimental evidence from cognitive psychology on how humans actually think.&#xA0; Maybe that will be enough to cross the stratospherically high threshold required for a discipline that lets you actually get it right, instead of just constraining you into interesting new mistakes.</p></div></div></div>
