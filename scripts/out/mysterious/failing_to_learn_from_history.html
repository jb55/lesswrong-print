  <div><p><strong>Continuation of:</strong>&#xA0; <a href="/lw/iy/my_wild_and_reckless_youth/">My Wild and Reckless Youth</a></p>
<p>Once upon a time, in <a href="/lw/iy/my_wild_and_reckless_youth/">my wild and reckless youth</a>, when I knew not the Way of Bayes, I gave a <a href="/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/">Mysterious Answer</a> to a mysterious-seeming question.&#xA0; Many failures occurred in sequence, but one mistake stands out as most critical:&#xA0; My younger self did not realize that <em>solving a mystery should make it feel less confusing.</em>&#xA0; I was trying to explain a Mysterious Phenomenon - which to me meant providing a cause for it, fitting it into an integrated model of reality.&#xA0; Why should this make the phenomenon less Mysterious, when that is its nature?&#xA0; I was trying to <em>explain</em> the Mysterious Phenomenon, not render it (by some impossible alchemy) into a mundane phenomenon, a phenomenon that wouldn't even call out for an unusual explanation in the first place.<br><br>As a Traditional Rationalist, I knew the historical tales of astrologers and astronomy, of alchemists and chemistry, of vitalists and biology.&#xA0; But the Mysterious Phenomenon was not like this.&#xA0; It was something <em>new, </em>something stranger, something more difficult, something that ordinary science had failed to explain for centuries -</p>
<p>- as if stars and matter and life had not been mysteries for hundreds of years and thousands of years, from the dawn of human thought right up until science finally solved them -</p>
<p>We learn about astronomy and chemistry and biology in school, and it seems to us that these matters have <em>always been</em> the proper realm of science, that they have <em>never been</em> mysterious.&#xA0; When science dares to challenge a new Great Puzzle, the children of that generation are skeptical, for they have never seen science explain something that <em>feels</em> mysterious to them.&#xA0; Science is only good for explaining <em>scientific</em> subjects, like stars and matter and life.</p><a id="more"></a><p>I thought the lesson of history was that astrologers and alchemists and vitalists had an <a href="/lw/hz/correspondence_bias/">innate character flaw</a>, a tendency toward mysterianism, which led them to come up with mysterious explanations for non-mysterious subjects.&#xA0; But surely, if a phenomenon really <em>was</em> very weird, a weird explanation might be in order?</p>
<p>It was only afterward, when I began to see the mundane structure inside the mystery, that I realized whose shoes I was standing in.&#xA0; Only then did I realize how reasonable vitalism had seemed<em> at the time</em>, how <em>surprising</em> and <em>embarrassing</em> had been the universe's reply of, "Life is mundane, and does not need a weird explanation."</p>
<p>We read history but we don't <em>live</em> it, we don't <em>experience</em> it.&#xA0; If only I had <em>personally</em> postulated astrological mysteries and then discovered Newtonian mechanics, postulated alchemical mysteries and then discovered chemistry, postulated vitalistic mysteries and then discovered biology.&#xA0; I would have thought of my Mysterious Answer and said to myself:&#xA0; <em>No way am I falling for that again.</em></p></div></div></div>
