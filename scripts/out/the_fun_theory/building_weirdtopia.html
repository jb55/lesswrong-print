<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Two roads diverged in the woods.&#xA0; I took the one less traveled, and had to eat bugs until Park rangers rescued me."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; -- Jim Rosenberg</p>
<p>Utopia and Dystopia have something in common: they both confirm the moral sensibilities you started with.&#xA0; Whether the world is a libertarian utopia of the non-initiation of violence and everyone free to start their own business, or a hellish dystopia of government regulation and intrusion - you might like to find yourself in the first, and hate to find yourself in the second; but either way you nod and say, "Guess I was right all along."</p>
<p>So as an exercise in creativity, try writing them down side by side:&#xA0; Utopia, Dystopia, and Weirdtopia.&#xA0; The zig, the zag and the zog.</p>
<p>I'll start off with a worked example for <em>public understanding of science:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Utopia:</em>&#xA0; Most people have the equivalent of an undergrad degree in something; <em>everyone</em> reads the popular science books (and they're <em>good </em>books); everyone over the age of nine understands evolutionary theory and Newtonian physics; scientists who make major contributions are publicly adulated like rock stars.</li>
<li><em>Dystopia:</em>&#xA0; Science is considered boring and possibly treasonous; public discourse elevates religion or crackpot theories; stem cell research is banned.</li>
<li><em>Weirdtopia:</em>&#xA0; <a href="/lw/p0/to_spread_science_keep_it_secret/">Science is kept secret to avoid spoiling the surprises</a>; no public discussion but intense private pursuit; cooperative ventures surrounded by fearsome initiation rituals because that's what it takes for people to feel like they've actually learned a Secret of the Universe and be satisfied; someone you meet may only know extremely basic science, but they'll have personally done revolutionary-level work in it, just like you.&#xA0; Too bad you can't compare notes.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/06/against-disclai.html">Disclaimer</a> 1:&#xA0; Not every sensibility we have is necessarily <em>wrong.</em>&#xA0; Originality is a goal of literature, not science; sometimes it's better to be right than to be new.&#xA0; But there are also such things as <a href="/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/">cached thoughts</a>.&#xA0; At least in my own case, it turned out that trying to invent a world that went outside my pre-existing sensibilities, did me a world of good.</p>
<p>Disclaimer 2:&#xA0; This method is not universal:&#xA0; Not all interesting ideas fit this mold, and not all ideas that fit this mold are good ones.&#xA0; Still, it seems like an interesting technique.</p>
<p>If you're trying to write science fiction (where originality <em>is</em> a legitimate goal), then you can write down anything nonobvious for Weirdtopia, and you're done.</p>
<p>If you're trying to do Fun Theory, you have to come up with a Weirdtopia that's at least <em>arguably-better </em>than Utopia.&#xA0; This is harder but also directs you to more interesting regions of the answer space.</p>
<p>If you can make all your answers <em>coherent</em> with each other, you'll have quite a story setting on your hands.&#xA0; (Hope you know how to handle characterization, dialogue, description, conflict, and all that other stuff.)</p>
<p>Here's some partially completed challenges, where I wrote down a Utopia and a Dystopia (according to the moral sensibilities I started with before <em>I</em> did this exercise), but inventing a (better) Weirdtopia is left to the reader.</p>
<p><em>Economic...</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Utopia:</em>&#xA0; The world is flat and ultra-efficient.&#xA0; Prices fall as standards of living rise, thanks to economies of scale.&#xA0; Anyone can easily start their own business and most people do.&#xA0; Everything is done in the right place by the right person under Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage.&#xA0; Shocks are efficiently absorbed by the risk capital that insured them.</li>
<li><em>Dystopia:</em>&#xA0; Lots of trade barriers and subsidies; corporations exploit the regulatory systems to create new barriers to entry; dysfunctional financial systems with poor incentives and lots of unproductive investments; rampant agent failures and systemic vulnerabilities; standards of living flat or dropping.</li>
<li><em>Weirdtopia:</em> _____</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sexual...</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Utopia:</em>&#xA0; Sexual mores straight out of a Spider Robinson novel:&#xA0; Sexual jealousy has been eliminated; no one is embarrassed about what turns them on; universal tolerance and respect; everyone is bisexual, poly, and a switch; total equality between the sexes; no one would look askance on sex in public any more than eating in public, so long as the participants cleaned up after themselves.</li>
<li><em>Dystopia:</em>&#xA0; 10% of women have never had an orgasm.&#xA0; States adopt laws to ban gay marriage.&#xA0; Prostitution illegal.</li>
<li><em>Weirdtopia:</em> _____</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Governmental...</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Utopia:</em>&#xA0; Non-initiation of violence is the chief rule. Remaining public issues are settled by democracy:&#xA0; Well reasoned public debate in which all sides get a free voice, followed by direct or representative majority vote.&#xA0; Smoothly interfunctioning Privately Produced Law, which coordinate to enforce a very few global rules like "no slavery".</li>
<li><em>Dystopia:</em>&#xA0; Tyranny of a single individual or oligarchy.&#xA0; Politicians with effective locks on power thanks to corrupted electronic voting systems, voter intimidation, voting systems designed to create coordination problems.&#xA0; Business of government is unpleasant and not very competitive; hard to move from one region to another.</li>
<li><em>Weirdtopia:</em> _____</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Technological...</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Utopia:</em>&#xA0; All Kurzweilian prophecies come true simultaneously.&#xA0; Every pot contains a chicken, a nanomedical package, a personal spaceship, a superdupercomputer, amazing video games, and a pet AI to help you use it all, plus a pony.&#xA0; Everything is designed by Apple.</li>
<li><em>Dystopia:</em>&#xA0; Those damned fools in the government banned everything more complicated than a lawnmower, and we couldn't use our lawnmowers after Peak Oil hit.</li>
<li><em>Weirdtopia:</em>&#xA0; _____</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cognitive...</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Utopia:</em>&#xA0; Brain-computer implants for everyone!&#xA0; You can do whatever you like with them, it's all voluntary and the dangerous buttons are clearly labeled.&#xA0; There are AIs around that are way more powerful than you; but they don't hurt you unless you ask to be hurt, sign an informed consent release form and click "Yes" three times.</li>
<li><em>Dystopia:</em>&#xA0; The first self-improving AI was poorly designed, everyone's dead and the universe is being turned into paperclips.&#xA0; Or the augmented humans hate the normals.&#xA0; Or augmentations make you go nuts.&#xA0; Or the darned government banned everything again, and people are still getting Alzheimers due to lack of stem-cell research.</li>
<li><em>Weirdtopia:</em>&#xA0; _____</li>
</ul>
