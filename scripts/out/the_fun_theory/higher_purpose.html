  <div><p><em>(This post is part of the <a href="/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence">Fun Theory Sequence</a>.)</em><br> <strong>Followup to</strong>:&#xA0; <a href="/lw/nb/something_to_protect/">Something to Protect</a>, <a href="/lw/lk/superhero_bias/">Superhero Bias</a></p>
<p>Long-time readers will recall that I've long been <a href="/lw/nb/something_to_protect/">uncomfortable</a> with the idea that you can adopt a Cause as a hedonic accessory:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Unhappy people are told that they need a 'purpose in life', so they should pick out an altruistic cause that goes well with their personality, like picking out nice living-room drapes, and this will brighten up their days by adding some color, like nice living-room drapes."</p>
<p>But conversely it's also a fact that having a Purpose In Life consistently shows up as something that increases happiness, as measured by reported subjective well-being.</p>
<p>One presumes that this works equally well <em>hedonically </em>no matter how <em>misguided </em>that Purpose In Life may be - no matter if it is <a href="/lw/kb/cant_say_no_spending/">actually doing harm</a> - no matter if the means are <a href="http://miscellanea.wellingtongrey.net/2008/12/01/prayer-vs-hard-work/">as cheap as prayer</a>.&#xA0; Presumably, all that matters for <em>your </em>happiness is that <em>you </em>believe in it.&#xA0; So you had better not question overmuch whether you're really being effective; that would disturb <a href="/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/">the warm glow of satisfaction you paid for.</a></p>
<p>And here we verge on <a href="/lw/m7/zen_and_the_art_of_rationality/">Zen</a>, because you can't deliberately pursue "a purpose that takes you outside yourself", <em>in order to take yourself outside yourself.</em>&#xA0; That's still all about <em>you.</em></p>
<p>Which is the whole Western concept of "spirituality" that I despise:&#xA0; <em>You</em> need a higher purpose so that <em>you</em> can be emotionally healthy.&#xA0; The external world is just a stream of victims for <em>you </em>to rescue.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Which is not to say that you can <a href="/lw/lk/superhero_bias/">become more noble by being less happy</a>.&#xA0; To <em>deliberately </em>sacrifice more, so that <em>you </em>can appear more virtuous to yourself, is also not a purpose outside yourself.</p>
<p>The way someone ends up with a real purpose outside themselves, is that they're walking along one day and see an elderly women passing by, and they realize "Oh crap, a hundred thousand people are dying of old age every day, what an awful way to die" and then they set out to do something about it.</p>
<p>If you want a purpose like that, then by <em>wanting</em> it, you're just circling back into <em>yourself </em>again.&#xA0; Thinking about <em>your </em>need to be "useful".&#xA0; Stop searching for <em>your purpose</em>.&#xA0; Turn your eyes <em>outward </em>to look at things outside yourself, and <em>notice </em>when you care about them; and then figure out how to be <em>effective, </em>instead of priding yourself on how much spiritual benefit you're getting <a href="/lw/uh/trying_to_try/">just for trying</a>.</p>
<p>With that said:</p>
<p>In today's world, most of the highest-priority legitimate Causes are about large groups of people in extreme jeopardy.&#xA0; (Wide scope * high severity.)&#xA0; Aging threatens the old, starvation threatens the poor, <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html">existential risks</a> threaten humankind as a whole.</p>
<p>But some of the potential <em>solutions </em>on the table are, arguably, so powerful that they could solve almost the entire list.&#xA0; Some argue that nanotechnology would take almost all our current problems off the table.&#xA0; (I agree but reply that nanotech would create other problems, like unstable military balances, crazy uploads, and brute-forced AI.)</p>
<p>I sometimes describe the <em>purpose </em>(if not the actual <a href="http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html">decision criterion</a>) of <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/ai-risk">Friendly superintelligence</a> as "Fix all fixable problems such that it is more important for the problem to be fixed <em>immediately </em>than fixed by our own efforts."</p>
<p>Wouldn't you then run out of victims with which to feed your higher purpose?</p>
<p>"Good," you say, "I should sooner step in front of a train, than ask that there be more victims just to keep myself occupied."</p>
<p>But do altruists then have little to look forward to, in the Future?&#xA0; Will we, deprived of victims, find our higher purpose shriveling away, and have to make a new life for ourselves as self-absorbed creatures?</p>
<p>"That unhappiness is relatively small compared to the unhappiness of a mother watching their child die, so screw it."</p>
<p>Well, but like it or not, the presence or absence of higher purpose <em>does</em> have hedonic effects on human beings, configured as we are now.&#xA0; And to reconfigure ourselves so that we no longer need to care about anything outside ourselves... does sound a little sad.&#xA0; I don't practice altruism <em>for the sake of being virtuous</em> - but I also recognize that "altruism" is part of what I value in humanity, part of what I want to save.&#xA0; If you save everyone, have you <a href="/lw/xg/emotional_involvement/">obsoleted</a> the will to save them?</p>
<p>But I think it's a false dilemma.&#xA0; Right now, in this world, any halfway capable rationalist who looks outside themselves, will find their eyes immediately drawn to large groups of people in extreme jeopardy.&#xA0; Wide scope * great severity = big problem.&#xA0; It doesn't mean that if one were to <em>solve </em>all those Big Problems, we would have nothing <em>left </em>to care about except ourselves.</p>
<p>Friends?&#xA0; Family?&#xA0; Sure, and also more abstract ideals, like Truth or Art or Freedom.&#xA0; The change that altruists may have to get used to, is the absence of any solvable problems so <em>urgent</em> that it doesn't matter whether they're solved by a person or an <a href="/lw/x5/nonsentient_optimizers/">unperson</a>.&#xA0; That <em>is </em>a change and a major one - which I am not going to go into, because <a href="/lw/xp/seduced_by_imagination/">we don't yet live in that world</a>.&#xA0; But it's not so sad a change, as having nothing to care about outside yourself.&#xA0; It's not the end of purpose.&#xA0; It's not even a descent into "spirituality": people might still look around outside themselves to see what needs doing, thinking more of effectiveness than of emotional benefits.</p>
<p>But I <em>will </em>say this much:</p>
<p>If all goes well, there will come a time when you could search the whole of civilization and never find a single person so much in need of help, as dozens you now pass on the street.</p>
<p>If you do want to save someone from death, or help a great many people - if you want to have that memory for yourself, later - then you'd better get your licks in <em>now.</em></p>
<p>I say this, because although that is not the <em>purest</em> motive, it is a <em>useful</em> motivation.</p>
<p>And for now - in this world - it is the <em>usefulness </em>that matters.&#xA0; That is the Art we are to practice <em>today</em>, however we <a href="/lw/xp/seduced_by_imagination/">imagine</a> the world might change tomorrow.&#xA0; We are not here to be our hypothetical selves of tomorrow.&#xA0; <em>This </em>world is our charge and our challenge; we must adapt ourselves to live <em>here</em>, not somewhere else.</p>
<p>After all - to care whether your motives were sufficiently "high", would just turn your eyes inward.</p></div></div></div>
