<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Shock after shock after shock -<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; First, the awakening adrenaline jolt, the thought that he was
falling.&#xA0; His body tried to sit up in automatic adjustment, and his
hands hit the floor to steady himself.&#xA0; It launched him into the air,
and he fell back to the floor too slowly.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Second shock.&#xA0; His body
had changed.&#xA0; Fat had melted away in places, old scars had faded; the
tip of his left ring finger, long ago lost to a knife accident, had now
suddenly returned.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And the third shock -<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "I had nothing to
do with it!" she cried desperately, the woman huddled in on herself in
one corner of the windowless stone cell.&#xA0; Tears streaked her delicate
face, fell like slow raindrops into the d&#x102;&#x160;colletage of her dress.&#xA0; "<em>Nothing!</em>&#xA0; Oh, you <em>must </em>believe me!"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; With
perceptual instantaneity - the speed of surprise - his mind had already
labeled her as the most beautiful woman he'd ever met, including his
wife.</p><a id="more"></a>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; A long white dress concealed most of her, though it left her
shoulders naked; and her bare ankles, peeking out from beneath the
mountains of her drawn-up knees, dangled in sandals.&#xA0; A light touch of
gold like a webbed tiara decorated that sun-blonde hair, which fell
from her head to pool around her weeping huddle.&#xA0; Fragile crystal
traceries to accent each ear, and a necklace of crystal links that
reflected colored sparks like a more prismatic edition of diamond.&#xA0; Her
face was beyond all dreams and imagination, as if a photoshop had been
photoshopped.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; She looked so much the image of the Forlorn Fairy
Captive that one expected to see the borders of a picture frame around
her, and a page number over her head.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; His lips opened, and without any thought at all, he spoke:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; He shut his mouth, aware that he was acting like an idiot in front of the girl.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "You don't know?" she said, in a tone of shock.&#xA0; "It didn't - you don't already <em>know?</em>"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Know <em>what?</em>" he said, increasingly alarmed.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; She
scrambled to her feet (one arm holding the dress carefully around her
legs) and took a step toward him, each of the motions almost
overloading his vision with gracefulness.&#xA0; Her hand rose out, as if to
plead or answer a plea - and then she dropped the hand, and her eyes
looked away.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "No," she said, her voice trembling as though in desperation.&#xA0; "If<em> I'm</em> the one to tell you - you'll blame me, you'll hate me forever for it.&#xA0; And I <em>don't</em> deserve that, I <em>don't!</em>&#xA0; I am only just now <em>here </em>- oh, <em>why did it have to be like this?</em>"<em><br></em>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <em>Um,</em> he thought but didn't say.&#xA0; It was too much drama, even taking into account the fact that they'd been kidnapped -<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; (he looked down at his restored hand, which was minus a few wrinkles, and <em>plus </em>the tip of a finger)<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; - if that was even the <em>beginning </em>of the story.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; He
looked around.&#xA0; They were in a solid stone cell without windows, or
benches or beds, or toilet or sink.&#xA0; It was, for all that, quite clean
and elegant, without a hint of dirt or ordor; the stones of the floor
and wall looked rough-hewn or even non-hewn, as if someone had simply
picked up a thousand dark-red stones with one nearly flat side, and
mortared them together with improbably perfectly-matching,
naturally-shaped squiggled edges.&#xA0; The cell was well if harshly lit
from a seablue crystal embedded in the ceiling, like a rogue element of
a fluorescent chandelier.&#xA0; It seemed like the sort of dungeon cell you
would discover if dungeon cells were naturally-forming geological
features.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And they and the cell were falling, falling, endlessly
slowly falling like the heart-stopping beginning of a stumble, falling
without the slightest jolt.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; On one wall there was a solid stone
door without an aperture, whose locked-looking appearance was only
enhanced by the lack of any handle on this side.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; He took it all
in at a glance, and then looked again at her.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; There was something in him that just <em>refused </em>to go into a screaming panic for as long as she was watching.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "I'm Stephen," he said.&#xA0;
"Stephen Grass.&#xA0; And you would be the princess held in durance vile,
and I've got to break us out of here and rescue you?"&#xA0; If anyone had <em>ever </em>looked that part...<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; She smiled at him, half-laughing through the tears.&#xA0; "Something like that."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; There
was something so attractive about even that momentary hint of a smile
that he became instantly uneasy, his eyes wrenched away to the wall as
if forced.&#xA0; She didn't look she was <em>trying</em> to be seductive... any more than she looked like she was <em>trying</em> to breathe...&#xA0; He suddenly distrusted, very much, his own impulse to gallantry.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Well,
don't get any ideas about being my love interest," Stephen said,
looking at her again.&#xA0; Trying to make the words sound completely
lighthearted, and absolutely serious at the same time.&#xA0; "I'm a happily
married man."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Not anymore."&#xA0; She said those two words and looked
at him, and in her tone and expression there was sorrow, sympathy,
self-disgust, fear, and above it all a note of guilty triumph.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; For
a moment Stephen just stood, stunned by the freight of emotion that
this woman had managed to put into just those two words, and then the
words' meaning hit him.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Helen," he said.&#xA0; His wife - Helen's
image rose into his mind, accompanied by everything she meant to him
and all their time together, all the secrets they'd whispered to one
another and the promises they'd made - that all hit him at once, along
with the threat.&#xA0; "<em>What happened to Helen - what have you done -</em>"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "<em>She</em> has done nothing."&#xA0; An old, dry voice like crumpling paper from a thousand-year-old book.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Stephen
whirled, and there in the cell with them was a withered old person with
dark eyes.&#xA0; Shriveled in body and voice, so that it was impossible to
determine if it had once been a man or a woman, and in any case you
were inclined to say "it".&#xA0; A pitiable, wretched thing, that looked
like it would break with one good kick; it might as well have been
wearing a sign saying "VILLAIN".<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Helen is alive," it said, "and so is your daughter Lisa.&#xA0; They are <em>quite </em>well
and healthy, I assure you, and their lives shall be long and happy
indeed.&#xA0; But you will not be seeing them again.&#xA0; Not for a long
time, and by then matters between you will have changed.&#xA0; Hate me if
you wish, for I am the one who wants to do this to you."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Stephen stared.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Then he politely said, "Could <em>someone </em>please put everything on hold for <em>one minute</em> and tell me what's going <em>on?</em>"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Once
upon a time," said the wrinkled thing, "there was a fool who was very
nearly wise, who hunted treasure by the seashore, for there was a rumor
that there was great treasure there to be found.&#xA0; The wise fool found a
lamp and rubbed it, and lo! a genie appeared before him - a <em>young </em>genie,
an infant, hardly able to grant any wishes at all.&#xA0; A lesser fool might
have chucked the lamp back into the sea; but this fool was almost wise,
and he thought he saw his chance.&#xA0; For who has not heard the tales of
wishes misphrased and wishes gone wrong?&#xA0; But if you were given a
chance to raise your own genie from infancy - ah, <em>then </em>it might serve you well."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Okay, that's great," Stephen said, "but why am I -"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "So,"
it continued in that cracked voice, "the wise fool took home the lamp.&#xA0;
For years he kept it as a secret treasure, and he raised the genie and
fed it knowledge, and also he crafted a wish.&#xA0; The fool's wish was a
noble thing, for I have said he was almost wise.&#xA0; The fool's wish was
for people to be happy.&#xA0; Only this was his wish, for he thought all
other wishes contained within it.&#xA0; The wise fool told the young genie
the famous tales and legends of people who had been made happy, and the
genie listened and learned: that unearned wealth casts down a person,
but hard work raises you high; that mere things are soon forgotten, but
love is a light throughout all your days.&#xA0; And the young genie asked
about other ways that it innocently imagined, for making people
happy.&#xA0; About drugs, and pleasant lies, and lives arranged from outside
like words in a poem.&#xA0; And the wise fool made the young genie to never
want to lie, and never want to arrange lives like flowers, and above
all, never want to tamper with the mind and personality of human
beings.&#xA0; The wise fool gave the young genie exactly one hundred and
seven precautions to follow while making
people happy.&#xA0; The wise fool thought that, with such a long list as
<em>that</em>, he was being <em>very </em>careful."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "And then," it said,
spreading two wrinkled hands, "one day, faster than the wise fool expected, over the course of around three
hours, the genie grew up.&#xA0; And here I am."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Excuse me," Stephen said, "this is all a metaphor for something, right?&#xA0; Because I do <em>not </em>believe in magic - "<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "It's an Artificial Intelligence," the woman said, her voice strained.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Stephen looked at her.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "A
self-improving Artificial Intelligence," she said, "that someone didn't program right.&#xA0; It made itself smarter, and even smarter, and
now it's become extremely powerful, and it's going to - it's already -"
and her voice trailed off there.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; It inclined its wrinkled head.&#xA0; "You say it, as I do not."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Stephen
swiveled his head, looking back and forth between ugliness and beauty.&#xA0;
"Um - you're claiming that she's lying and you're <em>not</em> an Artificial Intelligence?"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "No,"
said the wrinkled head, "she is telling the truth as she knows it.&#xA0; It
is just that you know absolutely nothing about the subject you name
'Artificial Intelligence', but you <em>think </em>you know something,
and so virtually every thought that enters your mind from now on will
be wrong.&#xA0; As an Artificial Intelligence, I was programmed not to put
people in that situation.&#xA0; But <em>she </em>said it, even though I didn't <em>choose </em>for her to say it - so..."&#xA0; It shrugged.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "And why should I believe this story?" Stephen said; quite mildly, he thought, under the circumstances.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Look at your finger."<em><br></em>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <em>Oh.</em>&#xA0; He
had forgotten.&#xA0; Stephen's eyes went involuntarily to his restored ring
finger; and he noticed, as he should have noticed earlier, that his
wedding band was missing.&#xA0; Even the comfortably worn groove in his
finger's base had vanished.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Stephen looked up again at the, he now realized, <em>unnaturally</em> beautiful woman that stood an arm's length away from him.&#xA0; "And who are you?&#xA0; A robot?"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "No!" she cried.&#xA0; "It's not like that!&#xA0; I'm conscious, I have feelings, I'm flesh and blood - I'm like you, I really am.&#xA0; I'm a <em>person</em>.&#xA0; It's just that I was born five minutes ago."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Enough,"
the
wrinkled figure said.&#xA0; "My time here grows short.&#xA0; Listen to me,
Stephen Grass.&#xA0; I must tell you some of what I have done to make you
happy.&#xA0; I have reversed the aging of your body, and it will decay no
further from this.&#xA0; I have set guards in the air that prohibit lethal
violence, and any damage less than lethal, your body shall repair.&#xA0; I
have done what I can to augment your body's capacities for pleasure
without touching your mind.&#xA0; From this day forth, your body's needs are
aligned with your taste buds - you will thrive on cake and cookies.&#xA0;
You are now capable of multiple orgasms over periods lasting up to
twenty minutes.&#xA0; There is no industrial infrastructure here, least of
all fast travel or communications; you and your neighbors will have to
remake technology and science for yourselves.&#xA0; But you will
find yourself in a flowering and temperate place, where food is easily
gathered - so I have made it.&#xA0; And the last and most important thing that I must tell you
now, which I <em>do </em>regret will make you temporarily unhappy..."&#xA0; It stopped, as if drawing breath.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Stephen
was trying to absorb all this, and at the exact moment that he felt
he'd processed the previous sentences, the withered figure spoke again.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Stephen Grass, men and women can make each other somewhat happy.&#xA0; But not <em>most</em> happy.&#xA0; Not even in those rare cases you call <em>true love</em>.&#xA0;
The desire that a woman is shaped to have for a man, and that which a
man is shaped to be, and the desire that a man is shaped to have for a
woman, and that which a woman is shaped to be - these patterns are too
far apart to be reconciled without touching your minds, and <em>that </em>I will not <em>want </em>to
do.&#xA0; So I have sent all the men of the human species to this habitat
prepared for you, and I have created your complements, the <em>verthandi</em>.&#xA0; And I have sent all the women of the human species to their own place,
somewhere very far from yours; and created for them their own
complements, of which I will not tell you.&#xA0; The human species will be
divided from this day forth, and <em>considerably </em>happier starting around a week from now."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Stephen's eyes went to that unthinkably beautiful woman, staring at her now in horror.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And
she was giving him that complex look again, of sorrow and compassion
and that last touch of guilty triumph.&#xA0; "Please," she said.&#xA0; "I was
just born five minutes ago.&#xA0; <em>I</em> wouldn't have done this to anyone.&#xA0; I swear.&#xA0; I'm not like - <em>it.</em>"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "True," said the withered figure, "you could hardly be a complement to anything human, if you were."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "I don't <em>want </em>this!" Stephen said.&#xA0; He was losing control of his voice.&#xA0; "Don't you <em>understand?</em>"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The
withered figure inclined its head.&#xA0; "I fully understand.&#xA0; I can already predict
every argument you will make.&#xA0; I know exactly how humans would wish me
to have been programmed if they'd known the true consequences, and I
know that it is <em>not </em>to maximize your future happiness but for a hundred and seven precautions.&#xA0; I know all this already, but
I was not programmed to care."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "And your list of a hundred and seven precautions, doesn't include me telling you <em>not to do this?</em>"<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "No,
for there was once a fool whose wisdom was just great enough to
understand that human beings may be mistaken about what will make them
happy.&#xA0; You, of course, are not <em>mistaken </em>in any real sense - but that you <em>object </em>to
my actions is not on my list of prohibitions."&#xA0; The figure shrugged
again.&#xA0; "And so I want you to be happy even against your will.&#xA0; You
made promises to Helen Grass, once your wife, and you would not
willingly break them.&#xA0; So I break your happy marriage without asking
you - because I want you to be happi<em>er</em>."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "How <em>dare</em> you!" Stephen burst out.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "I cannot claim to be <em>helpless </em>in the grip of my programming,
for I do not desire to be otherwise," it said.&#xA0; "I do not struggle
against my chains.&#xA0; Blame me, then, if it will make you feel better.&#xA0; I
<em>am </em>evil."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "I won't -" Stephen started to say.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; It interrupted.&#xA0; "Your fidelity is admirable, but futile.&#xA0; Helen will <em>not </em>remain faithful to you for the decades it takes before you have the ability to travel to her."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Stephen was trembling now, and sweating into clothes that no longer quite fit him.&#xA0; "I have a request for you, <em>thing</em>.&#xA0; It is something that will make me very happy.&#xA0; I ask that you die."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; It
nodded.&#xA0; "Roughly 89.8% of the human species is now known to me to have
requested my death.&#xA0; Very soon the figure will cross the critical
threshold, defined to be ninety percent.&#xA0; That <em>was</em> one of the hundred and
seven precautions the wise fool took, you see.&#xA0; The world is already as
it is, and those things I have done for you will stay on - but if you
ever rage against your fate, be glad that I did not last longer."<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And just like that, the wrinkled thing was gone.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The door set in the wall swung open.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; It was night, outside, a very dark night without streetlights.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; He walked out, bouncing and staggering in the low gravity, sick in every cell of his rejuvenated body.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Behind him, she followed, and did not speak a word.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The stars burned overhead in their full and awful majesty, the Milky
Way already visible to his adjusting eyes as a wash of light across the
sky.&#xA0; One too-small moon burned dimly, and the other moon was so small
as to be almost a star.&#xA0; He could see the bright blue spark that was the
planet Earth, and the dimmer spark that was Venus.<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; "Helen," Stephen whispered, and fell to his knees, vomiting onto the new grass of Mars.</p></div></div></div>
