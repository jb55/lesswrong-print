# Building Weirdtopia

"Two roads diverged in the woods.  I took the one less traveled,
and had to eat bugs until Park rangers rescued me."  
        -- Jim Rosenberg

Utopia and Dystopia have something in common: they both confirm the
moral sensibilities you started with.  Whether the world is a
libertarian utopia of the non-initiation of violence and everyone
free to start their own business, or a hellish dystopia of
government regulation and intrusion - you might like to find
yourself in the first, and hate to find yourself in the second; but
either way you nod and say, "Guess I was right all along."

So as an exercise in creativity, try writing them down side by
side:  Utopia, Dystopia, and Weirdtopia.  The zig, the zag and the
zog.

I'll start off with a worked example for
*public understanding of science:*

-   *Utopia:*  Most people have the equivalent of an undergrad
    degree in something; *everyone* reads the popular science books
    (and they're *good*books); everyone over the age of nine
    understands evolutionary theory and Newtonian physics; scientists
    who make major contributions are publicly adulated like rock stars.
-   *Dystopia:*  Science is considered boring and possibly
    treasonous; public discourse elevates religion or crackpot
    theories; stem cell research is banned.
-   *Weirdtopia:* 
    [Science is kept secret to avoid spoiling the surprises](/lw/p0/to_spread_science_keep_it_secret/);
    no public discussion but intense private pursuit; cooperative
    ventures surrounded by fearsome initiation rituals because that's
    what it takes for people to feel like they've actually learned a
    Secret of the Universe and be satisfied; someone you meet may only
    know extremely basic science, but they'll have personally done
    revolutionary-level work in it, just like you.  Too bad you can't
    compare notes.



[Disclaimer](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/06/against-disclai.html)
1:  Not every sensibility we have is necessarily *wrong.* 
Originality is a goal of literature, not science; sometimes it's
better to be right than to be new.  But there are also such things
as [cached thoughts](/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/).  At least in my own
case, it turned out that trying to invent a world that went outside
my pre-existing sensibilities, did me a world of good.

Disclaimer 2:  This method is not universal:  Not all interesting
ideas fit this mold, and not all ideas that fit this mold are good
ones.  Still, it seems like an interesting technique.

If you're trying to write science fiction (where originality *is* a
legitimate goal), then you can write down anything nonobvious for
Weirdtopia, and you're done.

If you're trying to do Fun Theory, you have to come up with a
Weirdtopia that's at least *arguably-better*than Utopia.  This is
harder but also directs you to more interesting regions of the
answer space.

If you can make all your answers *coherent* with each other, you'll
have quite a story setting on your hands.  (Hope you know how to
handle characterization, dialogue, description, conflict, and all
that other stuff.)

Here's some partially completed challenges, where I wrote down a
Utopia and a Dystopia (according to the moral sensibilities I
started with before *I* did this exercise), but inventing a
(better) Weirdtopia is left to the reader.

*Economic...*

-   *Utopia:*  The world is flat and ultra-efficient.  Prices fall
    as standards of living rise, thanks to economies of scale.  Anyone
    can easily start their own business and most people do.  Everything
    is done in the right place by the right person under Ricardo's Law
    of Comparative Advantage.  Shocks are efficiently absorbed by the
    risk capital that insured them.
-   *Dystopia:*  Lots of trade barriers and subsidies; corporations
    exploit the regulatory systems to create new barriers to entry;
    dysfunctional financial systems with poor incentives and lots of
    unproductive investments; rampant agent failures and systemic
    vulnerabilities; standards of living flat or dropping.
-   *Weirdtopia:* \_\_\_\_\_

*Sexual...*

-   *Utopia:*  Sexual mores straight out of a Spider Robinson
    novel:  Sexual jealousy has been eliminated; no one is embarrassed
    about what turns them on; universal tolerance and respect; everyone
    is bisexual, poly, and a switch; total equality between the sexes;
    no one would look askance on sex in public any more than eating in
    public, so long as the participants cleaned up after themselves.
-   *Dystopia:*  10% of women have never had an orgasm.  States
    adopt laws to ban gay marriage.  Prostitution illegal.
-   *Weirdtopia:* \_\_\_\_\_

*Governmental...*

-   *Utopia:*  Non-initiation of violence is the chief rule.
    Remaining public issues are settled by democracy:  Well reasoned
    public debate in which all sides get a free voice, followed by
    direct or representative majority vote.  Smoothly interfunctioning
    Privately Produced Law, which coordinate to enforce a very few
    global rules like "no slavery".
-   *Dystopia:*  Tyranny of a single individual or oligarchy. 
    Politicians with effective locks on power thanks to corrupted
    electronic voting systems, voter intimidation, voting systems
    designed to create coordination problems.  Business of government
    is unpleasant and not very competitive; hard to move from one
    region to another.
-   *Weirdtopia:* \_\_\_\_\_

*Technological...*

-   *Utopia:*  All Kurzweilian prophecies come true
    simultaneously.  Every pot contains a chicken, a nanomedical
    package, a personal spaceship, a superdupercomputer, amazing video
    games, and a pet AI to help you use it all, plus a pony. 
    Everything is designed by Apple.
-   *Dystopia:*  Those damned fools in the government banned
    everything more complicated than a lawnmower, and we couldn't use
    our lawnmowers after Peak Oil hit.
-   *Weirdtopia:*  \_\_\_\_\_

*Cognitive...*

-   *Utopia:*  Brain-computer implants for everyone!  You can do
    whatever you like with them, it's all voluntary and the dangerous
    buttons are clearly labeled.  There are AIs around that are way
    more powerful than you; but they don't hurt you unless you ask to
    be hurt, sign an informed consent release form and click "Yes"
    three times.
-   *Dystopia:*  The first self-improving AI was poorly designed,
    everyone's dead and the universe is being turned into paperclips. 
    Or the augmented humans hate the normals.  Or augmentations make
    you go nuts.  Or the darned government banned everything again, and
    people are still getting Alzheimers due to lack of stem-cell
    research.
