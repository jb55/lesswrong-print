# Failed Utopia 4-2

    Shock after shock after shock -  
    First, the awakening adrenaline jolt, the thought that he was
falling.  His body tried to sit up in automatic adjustment, and his
hands hit the floor to steady himself.  It launched him into the
air, and he fell back to the floor too slowly.  
    Second shock.  His body had changed.  Fat had melted away in
places, old scars had faded; the tip of his left ring finger, long
ago lost to a knife accident, had now suddenly returned.  
    And the third shock -  
    "I had nothing to do with it!" she cried desperately, the woman
huddled in on herself in one corner of the windowless stone cell. 
Tears streaked her delicate face, fell like slow raindrops into the
dĂŠcolletage of her dress.  "*Nothing!*  Oh, you *must*believe
me!"  
    With perceptual instantaneity - the speed of surprise - his
mind had already labeled her as the most beautiful woman he'd ever
met, including his wife.

    A long white dress concealed most of her, though it left her
shoulders naked; and her bare ankles, peeking out from beneath the
mountains of her drawn-up knees, dangled in sandals.  A light touch
of gold like a webbed tiara decorated that sun-blonde hair, which
fell from her head to pool around her weeping huddle.  Fragile
crystal traceries to accent each ear, and a necklace of crystal
links that reflected colored sparks like a more prismatic edition
of diamond.  Her face was beyond all dreams and imagination, as if
a photoshop had been photoshopped.  
    She looked so much the image of the Forlorn Fairy Captive that
one expected to see the borders of a picture frame around her, and
a page number over her head.  
    His lips opened, and without any thought at all, he spoke:  
    "Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-"  
    He shut his mouth, aware that he was acting like an idiot in
front of the girl.  
    "You don't know?" she said, in a tone of shock.  "It didn't -
you don't already *know?*"  
    "Know *what?*" he said, increasingly alarmed.  
    She scrambled to her feet (one arm holding the dress carefully
around her legs) and took a step toward him, each of the motions
almost overloading his vision with gracefulness.  Her hand rose
out, as if to plead or answer a plea - and then she dropped the
hand, and her eyes looked away.  
    "No," she said, her voice trembling as though in desperation. 
"If*I'm* the one to tell you - you'll blame me, you'll hate me
forever for it.  And I *don't* deserve that, I *don't!*  I am only
just now *here*- oh, *why did it have to be like this?*"*  
*   
*Um,* he thought but didn't say.  It was too much drama, even
taking into account the fact that they'd been kidnapped -  
    (he looked down at his restored hand, which was minus a few
wrinkles, and *plus*the tip of a finger)  
    - if that was even the *beginning*of the story.  
    He looked around.  They were in a solid stone cell without
windows, or benches or beds, or toilet or sink.  It was, for all
that, quite clean and elegant, without a hint of dirt or ordor; the
stones of the floor and wall looked rough-hewn or even non-hewn, as
if someone had simply picked up a thousand dark-red stones with one
nearly flat side, and mortared them together with improbably
perfectly-matching, naturally-shaped squiggled edges.  The cell was
well if harshly lit from a seablue crystal embedded in the ceiling,
like a rogue element of a fluorescent chandelier.  It seemed like
the sort of dungeon cell you would discover if dungeon cells were
naturally-forming geological features.  
    And they and the cell were falling, falling, endlessly slowly
falling like the heart-stopping beginning of a stumble, falling
without the slightest jolt.  
    On one wall there was a solid stone door without an aperture,
whose locked-looking appearance was only enhanced by the lack of
any handle on this side.  
    He took it all in at a glance, and then looked again at her.  
    There was something in him that just *refused*to go into a
screaming panic for as long as she was watching.  
    "I'm Stephen," he said.  "Stephen Grass.  And you would be the
princess held in durance vile, and I've got to break us out of here
and rescue you?"  If anyone had *ever*looked that part...  
    She smiled at him, half-laughing through the tears.  "Something
like that."  
    There was something so attractive about even that momentary
hint of a smile that he became instantly uneasy, his eyes wrenched
away to the wall as if forced.  She didn't look she was *trying* to
be seductive... any more than she looked like she was *trying* to
breathe...  He suddenly distrusted, very much, his own impulse to
gallantry.  
    "Well, don't get any ideas about being my love interest,"
Stephen said, looking at her again.  Trying to make the words sound
completely lighthearted, and absolutely serious at the same time. 
"I'm a happily married man."  
    "Not anymore."  She said those two words and looked at him, and
in her tone and expression there was sorrow, sympathy,
self-disgust, fear, and above it all a note of guilty triumph.  
    For a moment Stephen just stood, stunned by the freight of
emotion that this woman had managed to put into just those two
words, and then the words' meaning hit him.  
    "Helen," he said.  His wife - Helen's image rose into his mind,
accompanied by everything she meant to him and all their time
together, all the secrets they'd whispered to one another and the
promises they'd made - that all hit him at once, along with the
threat.  "*What happened to Helen - what have you done -*"  
    "*She* has done nothing."  An old, dry voice like crumpling
paper from a thousand-year-old book.  
    Stephen whirled, and there in the cell with them was a withered
old person with dark eyes.  Shriveled in body and voice, so that it
was impossible to determine if it had once been a man or a woman,
and in any case you were inclined to say "it".  A pitiable,
wretched thing, that looked like it would break with one good kick;
it might as well have been wearing a sign saying "VILLAIN".  
    "Helen is alive," it said, "and so is your daughter Lisa.  They
are *quite*well and healthy, I assure you, and their lives shall be
long and happy indeed.  But you will not be seeing them again.  Not
for a long time, and by then matters between you will have
changed.  Hate me if you wish, for I am the one who wants to do
this to you."  
    Stephen stared.  
    Then he politely said, "Could *someone*please put everything on
hold for *one minute* and tell me what's going *on?*"  
    "Once upon a time," said the wrinkled thing, "there was a fool
who was very nearly wise, who hunted treasure by the seashore, for
there was a rumor that there was great treasure there to be found. 
The wise fool found a lamp and rubbed it, and lo! a genie appeared
before him - a *young*genie, an infant, hardly able to grant any
wishes at all.  A lesser fool might have chucked the lamp back into
the sea; but this fool was almost wise, and he thought he saw his
chance.  For who has not heard the tales of wishes misphrased and
wishes gone wrong?  But if you were given a chance to raise your
own genie from infancy - ah, *then*it might serve you well."  
    "Okay, that's great," Stephen said, "but why am I -"  
    "So," it continued in that cracked voice, "the wise fool took
home the lamp.  For years he kept it as a secret treasure, and he
raised the genie and fed it knowledge, and also he crafted a wish. 
The fool's wish was a noble thing, for I have said he was almost
wise.  The fool's wish was for people to be happy.  Only this was
his wish, for he thought all other wishes contained within it.  The
wise fool told the young genie the famous tales and legends of
people who had been made happy, and the genie listened and learned:
that unearned wealth casts down a person, but hard work raises you
high; that mere things are soon forgotten, but love is a light
throughout all your days.  And the young genie asked about other
ways that it innocently imagined, for making people happy.  About
drugs, and pleasant lies, and lives arranged from outside like
words in a poem.  And the wise fool made the young genie to never
want to lie, and never want to arrange lives like flowers, and
above all, never want to tamper with the mind and personality of
human beings.  The wise fool gave the young genie exactly one
hundred and seven precautions to follow while making people happy. 
The wise fool thought that, with such a long list as *that*, he was
being *very*careful."  
    "And then," it said, spreading two wrinkled hands, "one day,
faster than the wise fool expected, over the course of around three
hours, the genie grew up.  And here I am."  
    "Excuse me," Stephen said, "this is all a metaphor for
something, right?  Because I do *not*believe in magic - "  
    "It's an Artificial Intelligence," the woman said, her voice
strained.  
    Stephen looked at her.  
    "A self-improving Artificial Intelligence," she said, "that
someone didn't program right.  It made itself smarter, and even
smarter, and now it's become extremely powerful, and it's going to
- it's already -" and her voice trailed off there.  
    It inclined its wrinkled head.  "You say it, as I do not."  
    Stephen swiveled his head, looking back and forth between
ugliness and beauty.  "Um - you're claiming that she's lying and
you're *not* an Artificial Intelligence?"  
    "No," said the wrinkled head, "she is telling the truth as she
knows it.  It is just that you know absolutely nothing about the
subject you name 'Artificial Intelligence', but you *think*you know
something, and so virtually every thought that enters your mind
from now on will be wrong.  As an Artificial Intelligence, I was
programmed not to put people in that situation.  But *she*said it,
even though I didn't *choose*for her to say it - so..."  It
shrugged.  
    "And why should I believe this story?" Stephen said; quite
mildly, he thought, under the circumstances.  
    "Look at your finger."*  
*    *Oh.*  He had forgotten. 
Stephen's eyes went involuntarily to his restored ring finger; and
he noticed, as he should have noticed earlier, that his wedding
band was missing.  Even the comfortably worn groove in his finger's
base had vanished.  
    Stephen looked up again at the, he now realized, *unnaturally*
beautiful woman that stood an arm's length away from him.  "And who
are you?  A robot?"  
    "No!" she cried.  "It's not like that!  I'm conscious, I have
feelings, I'm flesh and blood - I'm like you, I really am.  I'm a
*person*.  It's just that I was born five minutes ago."  
    "Enough," the wrinkled figure said.  "My time here grows
short.  Listen to me, Stephen Grass.  I must tell you some of what
I have done to make you happy.  I have reversed the aging of your
body, and it will decay no further from this.  I have set guards in
the air that prohibit lethal violence, and any damage less than
lethal, your body shall repair.  I have done what I can to augment
your body's capacities for pleasure without touching your mind. 
From this day forth, your body's needs are aligned with your taste
buds - you will thrive on cake and cookies.  You are now capable of
multiple orgasms over periods lasting up to twenty minutes.  There
is no industrial infrastructure here, least of all fast travel or
communications; you and your neighbors will have to remake
technology and science for yourselves.  But you will find yourself
in a flowering and temperate place, where food is easily gathered -
so I have made it.  And the last and most important thing that I
must tell you now, which I *do*regret will make you temporarily
unhappy..."  It stopped, as if drawing breath.  
    Stephen was trying to absorb all this, and at the exact moment
that he felt he'd processed the previous sentences, the withered
figure spoke again.  
    "Stephen Grass, men and women can make each other somewhat
happy.  But not *most* happy.  Not even in those rare cases you
call *true love*.  The desire that a woman is shaped to have for a
man, and that which a man is shaped to be, and the desire that a
man is shaped to have for a woman, and that which a woman is shaped
to be - these patterns are too far apart to be reconciled without
touching your minds, and *that*I will not *want*to do.  So I have
sent all the men of the human species to this habitat prepared for
you, and I have created your complements, the *verthandi*.  And I
have sent all the women of the human species to their own place,
somewhere very far from yours; and created for them their own
complements, of which I will not tell you.  The human species will
be divided from this day forth, and *considerably*happier starting
around a week from now."  
    Stephen's eyes went to that unthinkably beautiful woman,
staring at her now in horror.  
    And she was giving him that complex look again, of sorrow and
compassion and that last touch of guilty triumph.  "Please," she
said.  "I was just born five minutes ago.  *I* wouldn't have done
this to anyone.  I swear.  I'm not like - *it.*"  
    "True," said the withered figure, "you could hardly be a
complement to anything human, if you were."  
    "I don't *want*this!" Stephen said.  He was losing control of
his voice.  "Don't you *understand?*"  
    The withered figure inclined its head.  "I fully understand.  I
can already predict every argument you will make.  I know exactly
how humans would wish me to have been programmed if they'd known
the true consequences, and I know that it is *not*to maximize your
future happiness but for a hundred and seven precautions.  I know
all this already, but I was not programmed to care."  
    "And your list of a hundred and seven precautions, doesn't
include me telling you *not to do this?*"  
    "No, for there was once a fool whose wisdom was just great
enough to understand that human beings may be mistaken about what
will make them happy.  You, of course, are not *mistaken*in any
real sense - but that you *object*to my actions is not on my list
of prohibitions."  The figure shrugged again.  "And so I want you
to be happy even against your will.  You made promises to Helen
Grass, once your wife, and you would not willingly break them.  So
I break your happy marriage without asking you - because I want you
to be happi*er*."  
    "How *dare* you!" Stephen burst out.  
    "I cannot claim to be *helpless*in the grip of my programming,
for I do not desire to be otherwise," it said.  "I do not struggle
against my chains.  Blame me, then, if it will make you feel
better.  I *am*evil."  
    "I won't -" Stephen started to say.  
    It interrupted.  "Your fidelity is admirable, but futile. 
Helen will *not*remain faithful to you for the decades it takes
before you have the ability to travel to her."  
    Stephen was trembling now, and sweating into clothes that no
longer quite fit him.  "I have a request for you, *thing*.  It is
something that will make me very happy.  I ask that you die."  
    It nodded.  "Roughly 89.8% of the human species is now known to
me to have requested my death.  Very soon the figure will cross the
critical threshold, defined to be ninety percent.  That *was* one
of the hundred and seven precautions the wise fool took, you see. 
The world is already as it is, and those things I have done for you
will stay on - but if you ever rage against your fate, be glad that
I did not last longer."  
    And just like that, the wrinkled thing was gone.  
    The door set in the wall swung open.  
    It was night, outside, a very dark night without
streetlights.  
    He walked out, bouncing and staggering in the low gravity, sick
in every cell of his rejuvenated body.  
    Behind him, she followed, and did not speak a word.  
    The stars burned overhead in their full and awful majesty, the
Milky Way already visible to his adjusting eyes as a wash of light
across the sky.  One too-small moon burned dimly, and the other
moon was so small as to be almost a star.  He could see the bright
blue spark that was the planet Earth, and the dimmer spark that was
Venus.  
    "Helen," Stephen whispered, and fell to his knees, vomiting
onto the new grass of Mars.
