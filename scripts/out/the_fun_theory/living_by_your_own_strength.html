<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Myself, and Morisato-san... we want to live together by our own strength."</em></p>
<p>Jared Diamond once called agriculture "<a href="http://www.environnement.ens.fr/perso/claessen/agriculture/mistake_jared_diamond.pdf">the worst mistake in the history of the human race</a>".&#xA0; Farmers could grow more wheat than hunter-gatherers could collect nuts, but the evidence seems pretty conclusive that agriculture traded quality of life for quantity of life.&#xA0; One study showed that the farmers in an area were six inches shorter and seven years shorter-lived than their hunter-gatherer predecessors - even though the farmers were more numerous.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'd call agriculture a <em>mistake</em>.&#xA0; But one should at least be aware of the downsides.&#xA0; <a href="/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/">Policy debates should not appear one-sided</a>.</p>
<p>In the same spirit -</p>
<p>Once upon a time, our hunter-gatherer ancestors strung their own bows, wove their own baskets, whittled their own flutes.</p>
<p>And part of our alienation from that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Environment_of_evolutionary_adaptedness">environment of evolutionary adaptedness</a>, is the number of tools we use that we don't understand and couldn't make for ourselves.</p>

<p>You can look back on <em>Overcoming Bias</em>, and see that I've always been suspicious of borrowed strength.&#xA0; (Even before I understood the source of Robin's and my disagreement about the Singularity, that is.)&#xA0; In <a href="/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/">Guessing the Teacher's Password</a> I talked about the (well-known) problem in which schools end up teaching verbal behavior rather than real knowledge.&#xA0; In <a href="/lw/la/truly_part_of_you/">Truly Part of You</a> I suggested one test for false knowledge:&#xA0; Imagine deleting a fact from your mind, and ask if it would grow back.</p>
<p>I know many ways to prove the Pythagorean Theorem, including at least one proof that is purely visual and can be seen at a glance.&#xA0; But if you deleted the Pythagorean Theorem from my mind <em>entirely,</em> would I have enough math skills left to grow it back the next time I needed it?&#xA0; I hope so - certainly I've solved math problems that <em>seem</em> tougher than that, what with benefit of hindsight and all.&#xA0; But, as I'm not an AI, I can't actually switch off the memories and associations, and test myself in that way.</p>
<p>Wielding someone else's strength to do things beyond your own understanding - that really <em>is</em> as dangerous as the Deeply Wise phrasing makes it sound.</p>
<p>I observed in <a href="/lw/iz/failing_to_learn_from_history/">Failing to Learn from History</a> (musing on my <a href="/lw/u2/the_sheer_folly_of_callow_youth/">childhood foolishness</a> in offering a <a href="/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/">mysterious answer to a mysterious question</a>):&#xA0; "If only I had <em>personally</em> postulated astrological mysteries and then discovered Newtonian mechanics, postulated alchemical mysteries and then discovered chemistry, postulated vitalistic mysteries and then discovered biology.&#xA0; I would have thought of my Mysterious Answer and said to myself:&#xA0; <em>No way am I falling for that again.</em><em>"</em></p>
<p>At that point in my childhood, I'd been <em>handed</em> some techniques of rationality but I didn't exactly <em>own</em> them.&#xA0; Borrowing someone else's knowledge really doesn't give you anything <em>remotely </em>like the same power level required to discover that knowledge for yourself.</p>
<p>Would Isaac Newton have remained a mystic, even in that earlier era, if he'd <em>lived </em>the lives of Galileo and Archimedes instead of just reading about them?&#xA0; If he'd <em>personally </em>seen the planets reduced from gods to spheres in a telescope?&#xA0; If he'd <em>personally </em>fought that whole war against ignorance and mystery that had to be fought, before Isaac Newton could be handed math and science as a start to his further work?</p>
<p>We stand on the shoulders of giants, and in doing so, the power that we wield is far out of proportion to the power that we could generate for ourselves.&#xA0; This is true even of our revolutionaries.&#xA0; And yes, we couldn't begin to support this world if people could only use their own strength.&#xA0; Even so, we are losing something.</p>
<p>That thought occurred to me, reading about the Manhattan Project, and the petition that the physicists signed to avoid dropping the atomic bomb on Japan.&#xA0; It was too late, of course; they'd already built the bombs and handed them to the military, and they couldn't take back that gift.&#xA0; And so nuclear weapons passed into the hands of politicians, who could never have created such a thing through their own strength...</p>
<p>Not that I'm saying the world would necessarily have been a better place, if physicists had possessed sole custody of ICBMs.&#xA0; What does a physicist know about international diplomacy, or war?&#xA0; And it's not as if Leo Szilard - who first thought of the fission chain reaction - had personally invented science; he too was using powers beyond his own strength.&#xA0; And it's not as if the physicists on the Manhattan Project raised the money to pay for their salaries and their materials; they were borrowing the strength of the politicians...</p>
<p>But if no one had been able to use nuclear weapons without, say, possessing the discipline of a scientist <em>and</em> the discipline of a politician - without personally knowing enough to construct an atomic bomb <em>and</em> make friends - the world might have been a slightly safer place.</p>
<p>And if nobody had been able to construct an atomic bomb without first discovering for themselves the nature and existence of physics, then we would have been <em>much </em>safer from atomic bombs, because no one would have been able to build them until they were two hundred years old.</p>
<p>With humans leaving the game after just seventy years, we couldn't support this world using only our own strengths.&#xA0; But we have traded quality of insight for quantity of insight.</p>
<p>It does sometimes seem to me that many of this world's problems, stem from our using powers that aren't appropriate to seventy-year-olds.</p>
<p>And there is a higher level of strength-ownership, which no human being has yet achieved.&#xA0; Even when we run, we're just using the muscles that evolution built for us.&#xA0; Even when we think, we're just using the brains that evolution built for us.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that people should <a href="/lw/rc/the_ultimate_source/">create themselves from scratch without a starting point</a>.&#xA0; Just pointing out that it would be a different world if we understood our own brains and could redesign our own legs.&#xA0; As <em>yet </em>there's no human "rationalist" or "scientist", whatever they know about "how to think", who could actually <em>build a rational AI</em> - which shows you the limits of our self-understanding.</p>
<p>This is not the sort of thing that I'd suggest as an immediate alteration.&#xA0; I'm not suggesting that people should <em>instantly</em> on a silver platter be given full knowledge of how their own brains work and the ability to redesign their own legs.&#xA0; Because maybe people will be better off if they aren't <em>given </em>that kind of power, but rather have to work out the answer for <em>themselves.</em></p>
<p>Just in terms of anomie versus fun, there's a big difference between being able to do things for yourself, and having to rely on other people to do them for you.&#xA0; (Even if you're doing them with a brain you never designed yourself.)</p>
<p>I don't know if it's a principle that would stay until the end of time, to the children's children.&#xA0; Maybe better-designed minds could handle opaque tools without the anomie.</p>
<p>But it is part of the commonly retold prophecy of Artificial Intelligence and the Age of the Machine, that this era must be accompanied by <em>greater</em> reliance on things outside yourself, <em>more</em> incomprehensible tools into which you have <em>less </em>insight and <em>less</em> part in their creation.</p>
<p>Such a prophecy is not surprising.&#xA0; That <em>is </em>the way the trend has gone so far, in our culture that is too busy staying alive to optimize for fun.&#xA0; From the fire-starting tools that you built yourself, to the village candleseller, and then from the candleseller to the electric light that runs on strange mathematical principles and is powered by a distant generator...&#xA0; we are surrounded by things outside ourselves and strengths outside our understanding; we need them to stay alive, or we buy them because it's easier that way.</p>
<p>But with a sufficient surplus of power, you could start doing things the eudaimonic way.&#xA0; Start rethinking the life experience as a road to internalizing new strengths, instead of just trying to keep people alive efficiently.</p>
<p>A Friendly AI doesn't have to be a continuation of existing trends.&#xA0; It's not the Machine.&#xA0; It's not the alien force of technology.&#xA0; It's not mechanizing a factory.&#xA0; It's not a new gadget for sale.&#xA0; That's not where the shape comes from. What it <em>is </em>- is not easy to explain; but I'm reminded of doc Smith's description of the Lens as "the physical manifestation of a purely philosophical concept".&#xA0; That philosophical concept doesn't have to manifest as new buttons to press - <a href="http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html">if, on reflection, that's not what we would want</a>.</p></div></div></div>
