# Failing to Learn from History

Once upon a time, in
[my wild and reckless youth](/lw/iy/my_wild_and_reckless_youth/),
when I knew not the Way of Bayes, I gave a
[Mysterious Answer](/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/)
to a mysterious-seeming question.  Many failures occurred in
sequence, but one mistake stands out as most critical:  My younger
self did not realize that
*solving a mystery should make it feel less confusing.*  I was
trying to explain a Mysterious Phenomenon - which to me meant
providing a cause for it, fitting it into an integrated model of
reality.  Why should this make the phenomenon less Mysterious, when
that is its nature?  I was trying to *explain* the Mysterious
Phenomenon, not render it (by some impossible alchemy) into a
mundane phenomenon, a phenomenon that wouldn't even call out for an
unusual explanation in the first place.  
As a Traditional Rationalist, I knew the historical tales of
astrologers and astronomy, of alchemists and chemistry, of
vitalists and biology.  But the Mysterious Phenomenon was not like
this.  It was something *new,*something stranger, something more
difficult, something that ordinary science had failed to explain
for centuries -

- as if stars and matter and life had not been mysteries for
hundreds of years and thousands of years, from the dawn of human
thought right up until science finally solved them -

We learn about astronomy and chemistry and biology in school, and
it seems to us that these matters have *always been* the proper
realm of science, that they have *never been* mysterious.  When
science dares to challenge a new Great Puzzle, the children of that
generation are skeptical, for they have never seen science explain
something that *feels* mysterious to them.  Science is only good
for explaining *scientific* subjects, like stars and matter and
life.

I thought the lesson of history was that astrologers and alchemists
and vitalists had an
[innate character flaw](/lw/hz/correspondence_bias/), a tendency
toward mysterianism, which led them to come up with mysterious
explanations for non-mysterious subjects.  But surely, if a
phenomenon really *was* very weird, a weird explanation might be in
order?

It was only afterward, when I began to see the mundane structure
inside the mystery, that I realized whose shoes I was standing in. 
Only then did I realize how reasonable vitalism had
seemed*at the time*, how *surprising* and *embarrassing* had been
the universe's reply of, "Life is mundane, and does not need a
weird explanation."

We read history but we don't *live* it, we don't *experience* it. 
If only I had *personally* postulated astrological mysteries and
then discovered Newtonian mechanics, postulated alchemical
mysteries and then discovered chemistry, postulated vitalistic
mysteries and then discovered biology.  I would have thought of my
Mysterious Answer and said to myself: 
*No way am I falling for that again.*
