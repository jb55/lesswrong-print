# Guessing the Teachers Password

When I was young, I read popular physics books such as Richard
Feynman's
*QED: The [Strange](/lw/hs/think_like_reality/) Theory of Light and Matter.* 
I knew that light was waves, sound was waves, matter was waves.  I
took pride in my scientific literacy, when I was nine years old.

When I was older, and I began to read the
*Feynman Lectures on Physics,* I ran across a gem called "the wave
equation".  I could follow the equation's derivation, but,
[looking back](http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/polya.html), I
couldn't see its truth at a glance.  So I thought about the wave
equation for three days, on and off, until I saw that it was
embarrassingly obvious.  And when I finally understood, I realized
that the whole time I had accepted the honest assurance of
physicists that light was waves, sound was waves, matter was waves,
I had not had the vaguest idea of what the word "wave" meant to a
physicist.

There is an instinctive tendency to think that if a physicist says
"light is made of waves", and the teacher says "What is light made
of?", and the student says "Waves!", the student has made a true
statement.  That's only fair, right?  We accept "waves" as a
correct answer from the physicist; wouldn't it be unfair to reject
it from the student?  Surely, the answer "Waves!" is either *true*
or *false,* right?* *



Which is one more bad habit to
[unlearn from school](/lw/i2/two_more_things_to_unlearn_from_school/).
Words do not have intrinsic definitions. If I hear the syllables
"bea-ver" and think of a large rodent, that is a fact about my own
state of mind, not a fact about the syllables "bea-ver".  The
sequence of syllables "made of waves" (or
"[because of heat conduction](/lw/ip/fake_explanations/)") is not a
*hypothesis,* it is a pattern of vibrations traveling through the
air, or ink on paper.  It can *associate* to a hypothesis in
someone's mind, but it is not, of itself, right or wrong.  But in
school, the teacher hands you a gold star for *saying* "made of
waves", which must be the correct answer because the teacher heard
a physicist emit the same sound-vibrations.  Since verbal behavior
(spoken or written) is what gets the gold star, students begin to
think that verbal behavior has a truth-value.  After all, either
light is made of waves, or it isn't, right?

And this leads into an even worse habit.  Suppose the teacher
presents you with a [confusing problem](/lw/ip/fake_explanations/)
involving a metal plate next to a radiator; the far side feels
warmer than the side next to the radiator.  The teacher asks
"Why?"  If you say "I don't know", you have *no* chance of getting
a gold star - it won't even count as class participation.  But,
during the current semester, this teacher has used the phrases
"because of heat convection", "because of heat conduction", and
"because of radiant heat".  One of these is probably what the
teacher wants.  You say, "Eh, maybe because of heat conduction?"

This is not a* *hypothesis *about*the metal plate.  This is not
even a [proper belief](/lw/i7/belief_as_attire/).  It is an attempt
to *guess the teacher's password.*

Even visualizing the symbols of the diffusion equation (the math
governing heat conduction) doesn't mean you've formed a hypothesis
*about* the metal plate.  This is not school; we are not testing
your memory to see if you can write down the diffusion equation. 
This is Bayescraft; we are scoring your anticipations of
experience.  If you *use* the diffusion equation, by measuring a
few points with a thermometer and then trying to predict what the
thermometer will say on the next measurement, then it is definitely
connected to experience.  Even if the student just visualizes
something *flowing,* and therefore holds a match near the cooler
side of the plate to try to measure where the heat goes, then this
mental image of flowing-ness connects to experience; it controls
anticipation.

If you aren't *using* the diffusion equation - putting in numbers
and getting out results that control your anticipation of
particular experiences - then the connection between map and
territory is severed as though by a knife.  What remains
[is not a belief](/lw/i7/belief_as_attire/), but a verbal
behavior.  
In the school system, it's all about verbal behavior, whether
written on paper or spoken aloud.  Verbal behavior gets you a gold
star or a failing grade.  Part of unlearning this bad habit is
becoming consciously aware of the difference between an explanation
and a password.

Does this seem too harsh?  When you're faced by a confusing metal
plate, can't "Heat conduction?" be a first step toward finding the
answer?  Maybe, but only if you don't fall into the trap of
thinking that you are looking for a password.  What if there is no
teacher to tell you that you failed?  Then you may think that
"Light is wakalixes" is a good explanation, that "wakalixes" is the
correct password.  It happened to me when I was nine years old -
not because I was stupid, but because this is what happens
*by default.** *This is how human beings think, unless they are
trained *not* to fall into the trap.  Humanity stayed stuck in
holes like this for thousands of years.

Maybe, if we drill students that
*words don't count, only anticipation-controllers,* the student
will *not* get stuck on "Heat conduction? No?  Maybe heat
convection?  That's not it either?"  Maybe *then,* thinking the
phrase "Heat conduction" will lead onto a genuinely helpful path,
like:

-   "Heat conduction?"
-   But that's only a phrase - what does it mean?
-   The diffusion equation?
-   But those are only symbols - how do I apply them?
-   What does applying the diffusion equation lead me to
    anticipate?
-   It sure doesn't lead me to anticipate that the side of a metal
    plate farther away from a radiator would feel warmer.
-   I [notice](/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/) that I am
    [confused](/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/).  Maybe the near
    side just *feels* cooler, because it's made of more insulative
    material and transfers less heat to my hand?  I'll try measuring
    the temperature...
-   Okay, that wasn't it.  Can I try to verify whether the
    diffusion equation holds true of this metal plate, at all?  Is heat
    *flowing* the way it usually does, or is something else going on?
-   I could hold a match to the plate and try to measure how heat
    spreads over time...

If we are *not* strict about "Eh, maybe because of heat
conduction?" being a fake explanation, the student will very
probably get stuck on some wakalixes-password. 
*This happens by default, it happened to the whole human species for thousands of years.*
