# Belief as Attire

I have so far distinguished between belief as
[anticipation-controller](/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/),
[belief in belief](/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/),
[professing and cheering](/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/).  Of
these, we might call anticipation-controlling beliefs "proper
beliefs" and the other forms "improper belief".  A proper belief
can be wrong or irrational, e.g., someone who genuinely anticipates
that prayer will cure her sick baby, but the other forms are
arguably "not belief at all".

Yet another form of improper belief is belief as
group-identification - as a way of belonging.  Robin Hanson uses
the excellent
[metaphor](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/professing-and-.html#comment-78160476)
of wearing unusual clothing, a group uniform like a priest's
vestments or a Jewish skullcap, and so I will call this "belief as
attire".

In terms of
[humanly realistic psychology](/lw/i0/are_your_enemies_innately_evil/),
the Muslims who flew planes into the World Trade Center undoubtedly
saw themselves as heroes defending truth, justice, and the Islamic
Way from hideous alien monsters a la the movie
[Independence Day](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/).  Only a
very inexperienced nerd, the sort of nerd who has no idea how
non-nerds see the world, would say this out loud in an Alabama
bar.  It is not an American thing to say.  The American thing to
say is that the terrorists "hate our freedom" and that flying a
plane into a building is a "cowardly act".  You cannot say the
phrases "heroic self-sacrifice" and "suicide bomber" in the same
sentence, even for the sake of accurately describing how the Enemy
sees the world.   The very *concept* of the courage and altruism of
a suicide bomber is Enemy attire - you can tell, because the Enemy
talks about it.  The cowardice and sociopathy of a suicide bomber
is American attire.  There are no quote marks you can use to talk
about how the Enemy sees the world; it would be like dressing up as
a Nazi for Halloween.



Belief-as-attire may help explain how people can be *passionate*
about improper beliefs.  Mere
[belief in belief](/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/), or
[religious professing](/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/), would have
some trouble creating genuine, deep, powerful emotional effects. 
Or so I suspect; I confess I'm not an expert here.  But my
impression is this:  People who've stopped anticipating-as-if their
religion is true, will go to great lengths to *convince* themselves
they are passionate, and this desperation can be mistaken for
passion.  But it's not the same fire they had as a child.

On the other hand, it is very easy for a human being to genuinely,
passionately, gut-level belong to a group, to cheer
for[their favorite sports team](/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/). 
(This is the foundation on which rests the swindle of "Republicans
vs. Democrats" and analogous
[false dilemmas](/lw/hu/the_third_alternative/) in other countries,
but that's a topic for another post.)  Identifying with a tribe is
a very strong emotional force.  People will die for it.  And once
you get people to identify with a tribe, the beliefs which are
attire of that tribe will be spoken with the full passion of
belonging to that tribe.
