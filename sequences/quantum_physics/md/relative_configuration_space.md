[Previously](/lw/qm/machs_principle_antiepiphenomenal_physics/), we
saw Mach's idea (following in the earlier path of Leibniz) that
inertia is resistance to *relative* motion.  So that, if the whole
universe was rotating, it would drag the inertial frame along with
it.  From the perspective of General Relativity, the rotating
matter would generate gravitational waves.

All right:  It's possible that you can't tell if the universe is
rotating, because the laws of gravitation may be set up to make it
look the same either way.  But even if this turns out to be the
case, it may not yet seem *impossible to imagine* that things could
have been otherwise.

To expose Mach's Principle *directly,* we turn to Julian Barbour.

The diagrams that follow are stolen from Julian Barbour's
[The End of Time](http://www.amazon.com/End-Time-Next-Revolution-Physics/dp/0195117298). 
I'd forgotten what an amazing book this was, or I would have stolen
diagrams from it earlier to explain
[configuration space](/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/).
Anyone interested in the nature of reality must read this book. 
Anyone interested in understanding modern quantum mechanics should
read this book.  "Must" and "should" are defined as in
[RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

[![Jbarbourconfigurationcube\_2](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourconfigurationcube_2.png "Jbarbourconfigurationcube_2")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourconfigurationcube_2.png)Suppose
that we have three particles, A, B, and C, on a 2-dimensional
plane; and suppose that these are the *only* 3 particles in the
universe.

Let there be
a[classical configuration space](/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/)
which describes the 2D positions of A, B, and C.  3 classical 2D
particles require a 6-dimensional configuration space.

If your monitor cannot display 6-dimensional space, I've set a 2D
projection of a 3D cube to appear instead.  If you see what looks
like a window into an incomprehensible void, try using Firefox
instead of Internet Explorer.

The thing about this 6-dimensional cube, is that it contains
*too much information*.  By looking at an exact point in this cube
- supposedly corresponding to an exact state of reality - we can
read off information that A, B, and C will never be able to
observe.

The point (0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5) corresponds to A at (0, 1), B at (3,
4), and C at (2, 5).  Now consider the point (1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 5);
which corresponds to moving A, B, and C one unit to the right, in
unison.

Can A, B, and C ever detect any experimental difference?  Supposing
that A, B, and C can *only* see *each other,* as opposed to seeing
"absolute space" in the background?

After we shift the universe to the right (shift the origin to the
left), A looks around... and sees B and C at the same distance from
itself as before.  B and C can't detect any difference in the
universe either.

Yet we have described (0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5) and (1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 5) as
two different points in the configuration space.  Even though, to
A, B, and C, the associated states of reality seem
indistinguishable.  We have postulated an epiphenomenal
difference:  This suggests that our physics is not over the true
elements of reality.  (Remember, this has been, historically, a
highly productive line of reasoning!  It is not just
logic-chopping.)

Indeed, our classical configuration space has *many* epiphenomenal
differences.  We can rotate the three particles in unison, and end
up with a different point in the configuration space; while A, B,
and C again see themselves at the same distances from each other. 
The "rotation" that took place, was a matter of *us* looking at
them from a different angle, from *outside their universe*.  Which
is to say the "rotation" was a choice of viewpoint for *us*, not an
experimentally detectable fact *within* the ABC universe.

How can we rid the physics of mind projections and epiphenomena?

A and B and C cannot observe their absolute positions in space
against a fixed background.  Treating these absolute positions as
elements of reality may be part of our problem.

[![Jbarbourrelative](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourrelative.png "Jbarbourrelative")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourrelative.png)
What *can* A, B, and C observe?  By hypothesis, they can observe
their distances from each other.  They can measure the distances
AB, BC, and CA.

Why not use *that* as the dimensions of a configuration space?

At right is depicted a *relative configuration space* whose three
dimensions are the distances AB, BC, and CA.  It really is
3-dimensional, now!

If you're wondering why the configuration space looks pyramidal,
it's because any point with e.g. AB + BC < CA is "outside the
configuration space".  It does not represent a realizable triangle,
because one side is longer than the sum of the other two.  Likewise
AB + CA < BC and BC + CA < AB.

Every different point in this configuration space, corresponds to
an *experimentally different* state of reality that A, B, and C can
observe.

this assumes that ABC can measure absolute, rather than relative,
distances.  Otherwise, different slices of pyramid-space would be
observationally identical because they would describe the same
triangle at different scales, as shown at left.)

(Oh, and we're assuming that A, B, and C can tell each other apart
- perhaps they are different colors.)

The edges of each slice of the configuration space, are the
configurations with A, B, and C on the same line.  E.g., if AB + BC
= CA, then B lies on a point between A and C.

The corners of each slice are the configurations in which two
points coincide; e.g., AB=0, BC=CA.

[![Jbarbourtriangleland2](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtriangleland2.png "Jbarbourtriangleland2")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtriangleland2.png)
At right (or possibly below, depending on your screen width), is a
diagram showing a single slice in greater detail; Julian Barbour
credits this to his friend Dierck Liebscher.

The point in the center of the slice corresponds to an equilateral
triangle.

The dashed lines, which are axes of bilateral symmetry of the
configuration space, contain points that correspond to isosceles
triangles.

The curved lines are right-angled triangles.

Points "inside" the curved lines are acute triangles; points
"outside" the curved lines are obtuse triangles.

What about *three* points coinciding?

There is no triangle *at this scale* where all three points
coincide.

Remember, this is just one *slice*of the configuration space. 
Every point in the *whole* configuration space corresponds to what
ABC experience as a different state of affairs.

The configuration where A, B, and C are all in the same place is
*unique* in their experience.  So it is only found in *one* slice
of the configuration space:  The slice that is a single point, at
the tip of the infinite pyramid:  The degenerate slice where the
center and the corners are the same point:  The slice that is the
single point in configuration space:  AB=BC=CA=0.

Julian Barbour calls this point Alpha.

But I'm getting ahead of myself, here - that sort of thing is the
topic of tomorrow's post.

To see the power of a relative configuration space, observe how it
makes it impossible to *imagine*certain epiphenomenal differences:

Put your Newtonian goggles back on: imagine A, B, and C as little
billiard balls bouncing around in plain old space (not
configuration space) and time.  Perhaps A, B, and C attract each
other via a kind of gravity, and so orbit around one another.  If
you were looking at the evolution of A, B, and C in plain old space
and time, then a strobe-lit photograph of their motion might look
like this:

[![Jbarbourtriangleseries](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourtriangleseries.png "Jbarbourtriangleseries")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourtriangleseries.png)

In this time-series photograph, we've seen points A, B, and C
forming a triangle.  Not only do the points of the triangle orbit
around each other, but they also seem to be heading down and to the
right.  It seems like you can imagine the triangle heading off up
and to the right, or up and to the left, or perhaps spinning around
much faster.  Even though A, B, and C, who can only see their
distance to each other, would never notice the difference.

Now we could also map that whole trajectory over time, onto the
relative configuration space.  If AB+BC+CA happens to be a constant
throughout the evolution, then we could conveniently map the
trajectory onto one slice of configuration space:

[![Jbarbourshapepath](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourshapepath.png "Jbarbourshapepath")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/23/jbarbourshapepath.png)

(This doesn't actually represent the triangle-series shown above
it, but imagine that it does.)

If this is what you believe to be the *reality* - this trajectory
in the relative configuration space - then, if I ask you to
imagine, "Suppose that the triangle is heading up and to the left,
instead of down and to the right", I have just uttered
*physical nonsense.*  Mapping that alternative trajectory in
Newtonian space, onto the relative configuration space, would
produce just the same curve.  And if the laws of physics are over
the relative configuration space, then this curve is all there
*is.*

Imagine physics over trajectories in a relative configuration space
like this one, but with many more particles, and perhaps 3 space
dimensions.  Sentient beings evolve in this universe, on some
equivalent of a planet.  They hunt across fields that do not seem
to shift underfoot.  They have a strong illusion of moving through
an absolute space, against an absolute background; the relativity
of motion is hidden from them.

But if the fundamental laws of their universe were over relative
configurations, then it would not just be a *contingent* fact about
their universe, that if all the particles were speeding or
accelerating or rotating in unison, all the experiments would come
out the same.  Talking about "all the particles rotating in unison"
would be *physical nonsense*.  It only makes physical sense to talk
about the velocity of *some*particles relative to *other*
particles.

Your ancestors evolved on a savanna that seemed to stay put while
they ran across it.  You can, by an effort of mind, visualize a car
that stays motionless as the world zips past, or alternatively,
visualize a world that remains motionless as the car zips past. 
You can, by an effort of mind, see that the internal relations are
the same.  But it still seems to you that you are imagining two
different things.

Your visual neurology is representing objects in terms of absolute
positions against a fixed background.  There is a web of cortical
columns in your visual cortex that activate to create a mental
picture.  The particular columns that activate, are felt by you as
positions in your visual field.  That is
[how the algorithm feels from inside](/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/).

In a universe whose physics is over a relative configuration space,
the absolute positions, and the fixed background, are not elements
of reality.  They are
[mind projection fallacies](/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/), the
shadows of a point of view; as if your mind's eye were outside the
universe, and the universe could move relative to that.

But if you could learn to visualize the relative configuration
space, then, so long as you thought in terms of those elements of
reality, it would no longer be *imaginable* that Mach's Principle
could be false.

I am not entirely convinced of this notion of a relative
configuration space.  My soul as a computer programmer cries out
against the idea of representing N particles with N^2^ distances
between them; it seems wasteful.  On the other hand, I have no
evidence that the Tao is prejudiced against *redundant* or
*overconstrained* representations, in the same way that the Tao
seems prejudiced against *epiphenomena* in representations.  Though
my soul as a programmer cries out against it, better an
overconstrained representation than an epiphenomenal one.  Still,
it does not feel entirely satisfactory, to me.  It seems like
merely the *best*representation, not the *true*one.

Also, any
[position basis invokes an arbitrary space of simultaneity](/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/),
and a relative position basis does so as well.  As required by
Special Relativity, the choice makes no difference - but this means
that the relative position basis *still* contains epiphenomenal
information.  Perhaps the true representation will be more strictly
local, in terms of invariant states of distant entanglement, as
I've
[suggested before](/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/);
and maybe, who knows, it won't be overconstrained?

Relativizing the position basis feels to me like an *improvement,*
but it doesn't seem *finished.*

...

Of course, all this that we have said about the particles A, B, C
and their trajectory through time, cannot *possibly*apply to our
own universe.

In our *own*universe, as you may recall, there are no little
billiard balls bouncing around.

In our own universe, if physics took place in a relative
configuration space, it would be *quantum* physics in a relative
configuration space.  And a single moment of time, might look like
this:

[![Jbarbourtrianglecloud](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtrianglecloud.png "Jbarbourtrianglecloud")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtrianglecloud.png)
At right we see a cloud of red and blue mist, representing a
complex amplitude distribution over the relative configuration
space.  You could imagine that redness is the real part and
blueness is the imaginary part, or some such.  But this is not a
realistic amplitude distribution - just a representation of the
general idea, "A cloud of complex amplitude in configuration
space."

As for why only a sixth of the triangle is colored:  If A, B, and C
are the same species of particle, which is to say,
[identical particles](/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/), then the
configuration space collapses along the sixfold symmetry
corresponding to the six possible permutations of A, B, and C.

The whole cloud is a single static instant, in some arbitrary space
of simultaneity.  The quantum wavefunction is a distribution over
configuration space, not a single point in configuration space.  So
to represent the state of the universe at a single moment, we need
the whole cloud, which covers the entire collapsed configuration
space.

You might naturally tend to assume that we could represent
*time*using an animated version of this same diagram: and that the
animated diagram would show the mist churning in the configuration
space, the cloud's parts changing color, as amplitude flowed from
volume to volume; and that as the quantum waves propagated, little
blobs of amplitude density would move around through the
configuration space, in trajectories much resembling the classical
curve we saw earlier.

But that* *would be overcomplicating things.

Be aware:  Churning mist in a non-relative configuration space,
would be the metaphor that corresponds to the *standard*
formulation of physics.  That is, according to *standard* physics,
the description I just gave above, would be correct (after we took
it back out of the relative configuration space, which is *not*
standard).

Yet tomorrow we shall discuss a certain *further* simplification of
physics, which renders unimaginable still *another* epiphenomenal
distinction, and deletes a *further*needless element of the laws.
