I'm a good deal less of a lonely iconoclast than I seem.  Maybe
it's just the way I talk.

The points of departure between myself and *mainstream*
let's-reformulate-Science-as-Bayesianism is that:

(1)  I'm not in academia and can censor myself a *lot*less when it
comes to saying "extreme" things that others might well already be
thinking.

(2)  I think that
**just teaching probability theory won't be nearly enough**.  We'll
have to synthesize lessons from multiple sciences like cognitive
biases and social psychology, forming a new coherent
[Art](/lw/gn/the_martial_art_of_rationality/) of Bayescraft, before
we are actually going to do any better *in the real world* than
modern science.  Science tolerates errors, Bayescraft does not. 
Nobel laureate Robert Aumann, who first proved that Bayesians with
the same priors cannot agree to disagree, is a believing Orthodox
Jew.  Probability theory alone won't do the trick, when it comes to
really teaching scientists. 
*This is my primary point of departure, and it is not something I've seen suggested elsewhere.*

(3)  I think it *is* possible to do better in the real world.  In
the extreme case, a Bayesian superintelligence could use
*enormously* less sensory information than a human scientist to
come to correct conclusions.  First time you ever see an apple fall
down, you observe the position goes as the square of time, invent
calculus, generalize Newton's Laws... and see that Newton's Laws
involve action at a distance, look for alternative explanations
with increased locality, invent relativistic covariance around a
hypothetical speed limit, and consider that General Relativity
might be worth testing.  Humans do not process evidence
*efficiently* - our minds are so noisy that it requires orders of
magnitude more *extra* evidence to set us back on track after we
derail.  Our collective, academia, is even slower.
