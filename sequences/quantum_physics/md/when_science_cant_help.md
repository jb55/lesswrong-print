# When Science Can't Help

[Once upon a time, a younger Eliezer had a stupid theory](/lw/iy/my_wild_and_reckless_youth/). 
Let's say that Eliezer~18~'s stupid theory was that consciousness
was caused by closed timelike curves hiding in quantum gravity. 
This isn't the whole story, not even close, but it will do for a
start.

And there came a point where I looked back, and realized:

1.  I had carefully followed everything I'd been told was
    Traditionally Rational, in the course of going astray.  For
    example, I'd been careful to only believe in stupid theories that
    made novel experimental predictions, e.g., that neuronal
    microtubules would be found to support coherent quantum states.
2.  Science would have been perfectly fine with my spending ten
    years trying to test my stupid theory, only to get a negative
    experimental result, so long as I then said, "Oh, well, I guess my
    theory was wrong."

From Science's perspective, that is how things are *supposed* to
work - happy fun for everyone.  You admitted your error!  Good for
you!  Isn't that what Science is all about?

But what if I didn't want to waste ten years?

Well... Science didn't have much to say about *that.*  How could
Science say which theory was right, in *advance* of the
experimental test?  Science doesn't care where your theory comes
from - it just says, "Go test it."

This is the great strength of Science, and also its great
weakness.

[Gray Area asked](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/science-doesnt.html#comment-114553512):

> Eliezer, why are you concerned with untestable questions?

Because questions that are *easily immediately* tested are hard for
Science to get wrong.

I mean, sure, when there's already definite unmistakable
experimental evidence available, go with it.  Why on Earth wouldn't
you?

But sometimes a question will have very large, very definite
experimental consequences in your future - but you can't easily
test it experimentally *right now* - and yet there *is* a strong
*rational* argument.

Macroscopic quantum superpositions are readily testable:  It would
just take nanotechnologic precision, very low temperatures, and a
nice clear area of interstellar space.  Oh, sure, you can't do it
*right now*, because it's *too expensive*
or*impossible for today's technology* or something like that - but
in theory, sure!  Why, maybe someday they'll run whole
civilizations on macroscopically superposed quantum computers, way
out in a well-swept volume of a Great Void.  (Asking what quantum
non-realism says about the status of any observers inside these
computers, helps to reveal the underspecification of quantum
non-realism.)

This doesn't seem immediately pragmatically relevant to your life,
I'm guessing, but it establishes the pattern:  Not everything with
future consequences is *cheap*to test *now*.

Evolutionary psychology is another example of a case where
rationality has to take over from science.  While theories of
evolutionary psychology form a connected whole, only some of those
theories are readily testable experimentally.  But you still need
the other parts of the theory, because they form a connected web
that helps you to form the hypotheses that are actually testable -
and then the helper hypotheses are supported in a Bayesian sense,
but not supported experimentally.  Science would render a verdict
of "not proven" on individual parts of a connected theoretical mesh
that is experimentally productive as a whole.  We'd need a new kind
of verdict for that, something like "indirectly supported".

Or what about cryonics?

Cryonics is an archetypal example of an extremely important issue
(150,000 people die per day) that will have huge consequences in
the foreseeable future, but doesn't offer definite unmistakable
experimental evidence that we can get *right now.*

So do you say, "I don't believe in cryonics because it hasn't been
experimentally proven, and you shouldn't believe in things that
haven't been experimentally proven?"

Well, from a Bayesian perspective, that's incorrect. 
[Absence of evidence is evidence of absence](/lw/ih/absence_of_evidence_is_evidence_of_absence/)
only to the degree that we could reasonably expect the evidence to
appear.  If someone is trumpeting that snake oil cures cancer, you
can reasonably expect that,
*if the snake oil was actually curing cancer,* some scientist would
be performing a controlled study to verify it - that, at the least,
doctors would be reporting case studies of amazing recoveries - and
so the absence of this evidence is strong evidence of absence.  But
"gaps in the fossil record" are not strong evidence against
evolution; fossils form only rarely, and
*even if an intermediate species did in fact exist,* you cannot
expect with high probability that Nature will obligingly fossilize
it and that the fossil will be discovered.

Reviving a cryonically frozen mammal is just not something you'd
expect to be able to do with modern technology,
*even if future nanotechnologies could in fact perform a successful revival*. 
That's how I see Bayes seeing it.

Oh, and as for the actual arguments *for* cryonics - I'm not going
to go into those at the moment.  But if you followed the
[physics and anti-Zombie sequences](/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms/),
it should now seem a lot more plausible, that whatever preserves
the pattern of synapses, preserves as much of "you" as is preserved
from one night's sleep to morning's waking.

Now, to be fair, someone who says, "I don't believe in cryonics
because it hasn't been proven experimentally" is *misapplying* the
rules of Science; this is not a case where science actually gives
the *wrong answer.*  In the absence of a definite experimental
test, the verdict of science here is "Not proven".  Anyone who
interprets that as a rejection is taking an extra step outside of
science, not a misstep within science.

[John McCarthy's Wikiquotes page](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_McCarthy)
has him saying, "Your statements amount to saying that if AI is
possible, it should be easy. Why is that?"  The Wikiquotes page
doesn't say what McCarthy was responding to, but I could venture a
guess.

The general mistake probably arises because there *are* cases where
the absence of scientific proof is strong evidence - because an
experiment would be readily performable, and so failure to perform
it is itself suspicious.  (Though not as suspicious as I used to
think - with all the strangely varied anecdotal evidence coming in
from respected sources, why the *hell* isn't anyone testing
[Seth Roberts's theory of appetite suppression](http://sethroberts.net/about/whatmakesfoodfattening.pdf)?)

Another confusion factor may be that if you test Pharmaceutical X
on 1000 subjects and find that 56% of the control group and 57% of
the experimental group recover, some people will call that a
verdict of "Not proven".  I would call it an experimental verdict
of "Pharmaceutical X doesn't work well, if at all".  Just because
this verdict is theoretically retractable in the face of new
evidence, doesn't make it ambiguous.

In any case, right now you've got people dismissing cryonics out of
hand as "not scientific", like it was some kind of pharmaceutical
you could easily administer to 1000 patients and see what
happened.  "Call me when cryonicists actually revive someone," they
say; which, as Mike Li observes, is like saying "I refuse to get
into this ambulance; call me when it's actually at the hospital". 
Maybe Martin Gardner warned them against believing in strange
things without experimental evidence.  So they wait for the
definite unmistakable verdict of Science, while their family and
friends and 150,000 people per day are dying *right now,* and might
or might not be savable -

- a calculated bet you could only make *rationally.*

The drive of Science is to obtain a mountain of evidence so huge
that not even fallible human scientists can misread it.  But even
*that* sometimes goes wrong, when people become confused about
which theory predicts what, or bake extremely-hard-to-test
components into an early version of their theory.  And sometimes
you just can't get clear experimental evidence at all.

Either way, you have to try to do the thing that Science
[doesn't trust anyone to do](/lw/qb/science_doesnt_trust_your_rationality/)
- think rationally, and figure out the answer *before*you get
clubbed over the head with it.

(Oh, and sometimes a *disconfirming* experimental result looks
like: 
"[Your entire species has just been wiped out!](http://www.global-catastrophic-risks.com/) 
You are now scientifically required to relinquish your theory.  If
you publicly recant, good for you!  Remember, it takes a strong
mind to give up strongly held beliefs.  Feel free to try another
hypothesis next time!")
