# Quantum Non-Realism

> "Does the moon exist when no one is looking at it?"

Suppose you were just starting to work out a theory of quantum
mechanics.

You begin to encounter experiments that deliver different results
depending on how closely you observe them.  You dig underneath the
reality you know, and find an extremely precise mathematical
description that only gives you the relative frequency of outcomes;
worse, it's made of complex numbers.  Things behave like particles
on Monday and waves on Tuesday.

The correct answer is not available to you as a hypothesis, because
it will not be invented for another thirty years.

In a mess like that, what's the best you *could* do?



The best you can do is the *strict* "shut up and calculate"
interpretation of quantum mechanics.  You'll go on *trying* to
develop new theories, because doing your best doesn't mean giving
up.  But we've specified that the correct answer won't be available
for thirty years, and that means none of the new theories will
really be any good.  Doing the *best* you could theoretically do,
would mean that you recognized that, even as you looked for ways to
test the hypotheses.

The best you could theoretically do would *not* include saying
anything like, "The wavefunction only gives us probabilities, not
certainties."  That, in retrospect, was jumping to a conclusion;
the wavefunction gives us a certainty of many worlds existing.  So
that part about the wavefunction being only a probability, was
not-quite-right.  You calculated, but failed to shut up.

If you do the *best* that you can do without the correct answer
being available, then, when you hear about decoherence, it will
turn out that you have not said *anything* incompatible with
decoherence.  Decoherence is not ruled out by the data and the
calculations.  So if you refuse to affirm, as positive knowledge,
any proposition which was not forced by the data and the
calculations, the calculations will not *force* you to say anything
incompatible with decoherence.  So too with whatever the correct
theory may be, if it is not decoherence.  If you go astray, it must
be from your own impulses.

But it is hard for human beings to shut up and calculate - *really*
shut up and calculate. There is an overwhelming tendency to treat
our ignorance as if it were positive knowledge.

I don't know if any conversations like this ever really took place,
but this is how ignorance becomes knowledge:

> Goofus:  "Why?"

> Goofus:  "Gallant told me."

A similar transformation occurs in the leap from:

And again:

> zero!"

The whole slip from:

> *The square of this "amplitude" stuff corresponds tightly to our experimentally observed frequencies*

to

> *The amplitude is the probability of getting the measurement*

to

> *Well, obviously, once you know you*didn't*get a measurement, its probability becomes zero*

has got to be one of the most embarrassing wrong turns in the
history of science.

If you take all this *literally*, it becomes the
consciousness-causes-collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics. 
These days, just about nobody will confess to *actually*believing
in the consciousness-causes-collapse interpretation of quantum
mechanics -

But the physics textbooks are still written this way!  People say
they don't believe it, but they *talk as if* knowledge is
responsible for removing incompatible "probability" amplitudes.

Yet as implausible as I find consciousness-causes-collapse, it at
least gives us a picture of reality.  Sure, it's an informal
picture.  Sure, it gives mental properties ontologically basic
status.  You can't *calculate* when an "experimental observation"
occurs or what people "know", you *just know* when certain
probabilities are *obviously* zero.  And this "just knowing" just
happens to fit your experimental results, whatever they are -

- but at least consciousness-causes-collapse purports to tell us
how the universe works.  The amplitudes are real, the collapse is
real, the consciousness is real.

Contrast to this argument schema:

> soon as the measurement tells me it's not true?"

What does Goofus even *mean*, here?  Never mind the plausibility of
his words; what sort of state of reality would correspond to his
words being true?

What way could reality *be,* that would make it meaningless to talk
about Special Relativity being violated, because the property being
influenced didn't exist, even though you could calculate the
changes to it?

But you know what?  Forget that.  I want to know the answer to an
even more important question:

Where is Goofus *getting* all this stuff?

Let's suppose that you take the Schrödinger equation, and assert,
as a positive fact:

> "This equation generates good predictions, but it doesn't mean
> anything!"

Really?  *How do you know?*

I sometimes go around saying that the fundamental question of
rationality is *Why do you believe what you believe?*

You say the Schrödinger equation "doesn't mean anything".  How did
this item of definite knowledge end up in your possession, if it is
not simply ignorance misinterpreted as knowledge?

Was there some experiment that told you?  I am open to the idea
that experiments can tell us things that seem philosophically
impossible.  But in this case I should like to see the decisive
data.  Was there a point where you carefully set up an experimental
apparatus, and worked out what you should expect to see if (1) the
Schrödinger equation was meaningful or (2) the Schrödinger equation
was meaningless; and then you got result (2)?

How do you know?

How did you acquire that piece of knowledge, Goofus?  I know where
Gallant got *his*  - but where did *yours* come from?

My attitude toward questions of existence and meaning was nicely
illustrated in a discussion of the current state of evidence for
[whether the universe is spatially finite or spatially infinite](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/06/1_2_3_infinity.html),
in which James D. Miller
[chided Robin Hanson](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/06/1_2_3_infinity.html#comment-72680096):

To which I
[replied](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/06/1_2_3_infinity.html#comment-72695588):

Ha!  You think pulling that old "universe doesn't exist" trick will
stop me?  It won't even slow me down!

It's not that I'm *ruling out* the possibility that the universe
doesn't exist.  It's just that, *even* *if* nothing exists, I still
want to understand the nothing as best I can.  My
[curiosity](http://yudkowsky.net/virtues/) doesn't suddenly go away
just because there's no reality, you know!

The nature of "reality" is something about which I'm still
confused, which leaves open the possibility that there isn't any
such thing.  But Egan's Law still applies:  "It all adds up to
normality."  Apples didn't stop falling when Einstein disproved
Newton's theory of gravity.

Sure, when the dust settles, it could turn out that apples don't
exist, Earth doesn't exist, reality doesn't exist.  But the
nonexistent apples will still fall toward the nonexistent ground at
a meaningless rate of 9.8 m/s^2^.

You say the universe doesn't exist?  Fine, suppose I believe that -
though it's not clear *what* I'm supposed to believe, aside from
[repeating the words](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/guessing-the-te.html).

Now, what happens if I press *this* button?

In [The Simple Truth](http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/truth.html), I
said:

> "Frankly, I'm not entirely sure myself where this 'reality'
> business comes from. I can't create my own reality in the lab, so I

You want to say that the quantum-mechanical equations are "not
real"?  I'll be charitable, and suppose this means something.  What
might it mean?

Maybe it means the equations which determine my predictions are
substantially different from the thingy that determines my
experimental results.  Then what *does*determine my experimental
results?  If you tell me "nothing", I would like to know what sort
of "nothing" it is, and why this "nothing" exhibits such apparent
regularity in determining e.g. my experimental measurements of the
mass of an electron.

I don't take well to people who tell me to
[stop asking questions](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/explainworshipi.html). 
If you tell me something is definitely positively meaningless, I
want to know exactly what you mean by that, and how you came to
know.  Otherwise you have not given me an answer, only told me to
stop asking the question.

"The Simple Truth" describes the life of a shepherd and apprentice
who have discovered how to count sheep by tossing pebbles into
buckets, when they are visited by a delegate from the court who
wants to know how the "magic pebbles" work.  The shepherd tries to
explain, "An empty bucket is magical if and only if the pastures
are empty of sheep", but is soon overtaken about the excited
discussions of the apprentice and the delegate as to how the magic
might get into the pebbles.

Here we have quantum equations that deliver excellent experimental
predictions.  What *exactly* does it mean for them to be
"meaningless"?  Is it like a bucket of pebbles that
*works for counting sheep*, but *doesn't have any magic*?* *

Back before
[Bell's Theorem](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/bells-theorem-n.html)
ruled out local hidden variables, it seemed possible that (as
Einstein thought) there was some more complete description of
reality which we didn't have, and the quantum theory summarized
incomplete knowledge of this more complete description.  The laws
we'd learned would turn out to be like the laws of statistical
mechanics: quantitative statements of uncertainty.  This would
hardly make the equations "meaningless"; partial knowledge *is*the
meaning of
[probability](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/mind-probabilit.html).

But Bell's Theorem makes it much less plausible that the quantum
equations are partial knowledge of something deterministic, the way
that statistical mechanics over classical physics is partial
knowledge of something deterministic.  And even so, the quantum
equations would not be "meaningless" as that phrase is usually
taken; they would be "statistical", "approximate", "partial
information", or at worst "wrong".

Here we have equations that give us excellent predictions.  You say
they are "meaningless".  I ask what it is that determines my
experimental results, then.  You cannot answer.  Fine, then how do
you justify ruling out the possibility that the quantum equations
give such excellent predictions because they are, oh, say,
*meaningful?*

I don't mean to trivialize questions of reality or meaning.  But to
call something "meaningless" and say that the argument is now
resolved, finished, over, done with, you must have a theory of
exactly how it is meaningless.  And when the *answer* is given, the
question should seem
[no longer mysterious](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/mysterious-answ.html).

As you may recall from
[Semantic Stopsigns](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/semantic-stopsi.html),
there are words and phrases which are not so much *answers* to
questions, as cognitive traffic signals which indicate you should
*stop asking* questions.  "Why does anything exist in the first
place?  God!" is the classical example, but there are others, such
as "Elan vital!"

Tell people to "shut up and calculate" because you don't know what
the calculations mean, and inside of five years, "Shut up!" will be
masquerading as a positive theory of quantum mechanics.

I have the *highest* respect for any historical physicists who even
came *close* to *actually* shutting up and calculating, who were
genuinely conservative in assessing what they did and didn't know. 
This is the best they could possibly do without actually being Hugh
Everett, and I award them fifty rationality points.  My scorn is
reserved for those who interpreted "We don't know why it works" as
the positive knowledge that the equations were definitely not
real.

I mean, if that trick worked, it would be too good to confine to
one subfield.  Why shouldn't physicists use the "not real" loophole
*outside*of quantum mechanics?

And if that doesn't work, try writing yourself a "Get Out Of Jail
Free" card.

If there is a moral to the whole story, it is the moral of how very
hard it is to stay in a state of *confessed* confusion, without
making up a story that gives you closure - how hard it is to avoid
manipulating your ignorance as if it were definite knowledge that
you possessed.

PS:  I now declare open season for any quantum non-realists out
there, if they have something they'd like to say.
