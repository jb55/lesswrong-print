RI, you've got no idea how glad I was to see you post that
comment.

Of course I had more than just *one* reason for spending all that
time posting about quantum physics.  I like having lots of hidden
motives, it's the closest I can ethically get to being a
supervillain.

But to give an example of a purpose I could *only* accomplish by
discussing quantum physics...

In physics, you can get absolutely clear-cut issues.  Not in the
sense that the issues are trivial to explain.  But if you try to
apply Bayes to healthcare, or economics, you may not be able to
*formally* lay out what is the simplest hypothesis, or what the
evidence supports.  But when I say "macroscopic decoherence is
simpler than collapse" it is actually *strict* simplicity; you
could write the two hypotheses out as computer programs and count
the lines of code. Nor is the evidence itself in dispute.

I wanted a very clear example - *Bayes says "zig", this is a zag* -
when it came time to break your allegiance to Science.

"Oh, sure," you say, "the physicists messed up the many-worlds
thing, but give them a break, Eliezer!  No one ever claimed that
the social process of science was perfect.  People are human; they
make mistakes."

But the physicists who refuse to adopt many-worlds aren't
disobeying the rules of Science.  They're *obeying* the rules of
Science.

The tradition handed down through the generations says that a new
physics theory comes up with new experimental predictions that
distinguish it from the old theory.  You perform the test, and the
new theory is confirmed or falsified.  If it's confirmed, you hold
a huge celebration, call the newspapers, and hand out Nobel Prizes
for everyone; any doddering old emeritus professors who refuse to
convert are quietly humored.  If the theory is disconfirmed, the
lead proponent publicly recants, and gains a reputation for
honesty.

This is not how things *do*work in science; rather it is how things
are *supposed* to work in Science.  It's the ideal to which all
good scientists aspire.

Now many-worlds comes along, and it doesn't seem to make any new
predictions relative to the old theory.  That's suspicious.  And
there's all these other worlds, but you can't see them.  That's
*really*suspicious.  It just doesn't seem scientific.

If you got as far as RI - so that many-worlds now seems perfectly
logical, obvious and normal - *and* you also started out as a
Traditional Rationalist, then you should be able to switch back and
forth between the Scientific view and the Bayesian view, like a
Necker Cube.

So now put on your Science Goggles - you've still got them around
somewhere, right?  Forget everything you know about Kolmogorov
complexity, Solomonoff induction or Minimum Message Lengths. 
That's not part of the traditional training.  You just eyeball
something to see how "simple" it looks.  The word "testable"
doesn't conjure up a mental image of Bayes's Theorem governing
probability flows; it conjures up a mental image of being in a lab,
performing an experiment, and having the celebration (or public
recantation) afterward.

Science-Goggles off, Bayes-Goggles back on:

Okay, so is this a problem we can fix in five minutes with some
duct tape and superglue?

No.

Huh?  Why not just teach new graduating classes of scientists about
Solomonoff induction and Bayes's Rule?

Centuries ago, there was a widespread idea that the Wise could
unravel the secrets of the universe just by thinking about them,
while to go out and *look* at things was lesser, inferior, naive,
and would just delude you in the end.  You couldn't trust the way
things *looked* - only thought could be your guide.

Science began as a rebellion against this Deep Wisdom.  At the core
is the pragmatic belief that human beings, sitting around in their
armchairs trying to be Deeply Wise, just drift off into never-never
land.  You couldn't trust your thoughts.  You had to make advance
experimental predictions - predictions that no one else had made
before - run the test, and confirm the result.  That was evidence. 
Sitting in your armchair, thinking about what seemed reasonable...
would not be taken to *prejudice* your theory, because Science
wasn't an idealistic belief about pragmatism, or getting your hands
dirty.  It was, rather, the dictum that experiment alone would
decide.  Only experiments could judge your theory - not your
nationality, or your religious professions, or the fact that you'd
invented the theory in your armchair.  Only experiments!  If you
sat in your armchair and came up with a theory that made a novel
prediction, and experiment confirmed the prediction, then we would
care about the result of the experiment, not where your hypothesis
came from.

*That's* Science.  And if you say that Many-Worlds should replace
the immensely successful Copenhagen Interpretation, adding on all
these twin Earths that can't be observed, just because it
*sounds more reasonable and elegant* - not because it
*crushed the old theory with a superior experimental prediction* -
then you're undoing the core scientific rule that prevents people
from running out and putting angels into all the theories, because
angels are more reasonable and elegant.

You think teaching a few people about Solomonoff induction is going
to solve *that* problem?  Nobel laureate Robert Aumann - who first
proved that Bayesian agents with similar priors cannot agree to
disagree - is a believing Orthodox Jew.  Aumann helped a project to
test the Torah for "Bible codes", hidden prophecies from God - and
concluded that the project had failed to confirm the codes'
existence.  Do you want Aumann thinking that once you've got
Solomonoff induction, you can forget about the experimental
method?  Do you think that's going to help him?  And most
scientists out there will not rise to the level of Robert Aumann.

Okay, Bayes-Goggles back on.  Are you *really* going to believe
that large parts of the wavefunction disappear when you can no
longer see them?  As a result of the only non-linear non-unitary
non-differentiable non-CPT-symmetric acausal faster-than-light
informally-specified phenomenon in all of physics?  Just because,
by sheer historical contingency, the stupid version of the theory
was proposed first?

Are you going to make a major modification to a scientific model,
and believe in zillions of other worlds you can't see, without a
defining moment of experimental triumph over the old model?

Or are you going to reject probability theory?

Will you give your allegiance to Science, or to Bayes?

Michael Vassar once observed (tongue-in-cheek) that it was a good
thing that a majority of the human species believed in God, because
otherwise, he would have a very hard time rejecting
[majoritarianism](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/03/on_majoritarian.html).
But since the majority opinion that God exists is simply
unbelievable, we have no choice but to reject the extremely strong
philosophical arguments for majoritarianism.

You can see (one of the reasons) why I went to such lengths to
explain quantum theory.  Those who are good at math should now be
able to *visualize* both
[macroscopic decoherence](/lw/pu/on_being_decoherent/), and the
probability theory of
[simplicity and testability](/lw/q3/decoherence_is_simple/) - get
the insanity of a global single world on a *gut* level.

I wanted to present you with a nice, sharp dilemma between
rejecting the scientific method, or embracing insanity.

Why?  I'll give you a hint:  It's not just because I'm evil.  If
you would guess my motives here, think beyond the first obvious
answer.

PS:  If you try to come up with clever ways to wriggle out of the
dilemma, you're just going to get shot down in future posts.  You
have been warned.
