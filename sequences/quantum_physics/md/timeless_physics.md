I shall begin by asking a incredibly deep question:

What time is it?

If you have the
[excellent habit](http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/truth.html) of giving
obvious answers to obvious questions, you will answer, "It is now
7:30pm [or whatever]."

How do you know?

"I know because I looked at the clock on my computer monitor."

Well, suppose I hacked into your computer and changed the clock. 
Would it then be a different time?

"No," you reply.

How do you know?

"Because I once used the 'Set Date and Time' facility on my
computer to try and make it be the 22nd century, but it didn't
work."

Ah.  And how do you *know* that it *didn't* work?

"Because," you say, "I looked outside, and the buildings were still
made of brick and wood and steel, rather than having been replaced
by the gleaming crystal of diamondoid nanotechnological
constructions; and gasoline was still only $4/gallon."

You have... *interesting*... expectations for the
[22nd century](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/stranger-than-h.html);
but let's not go into that.  Suppose I replaced the buildings
outside your home with confections of crystal, and raised the price
of gas; *then* would it be 100 years later?

"No," you say, "I could look up at the night sky, and see the
planets in roughly the same position as yesterday's night; with a
powerful telescope I could measure the positions of the stars as
they very slowly drift, relative to the Sun, and observe the
rotation of distant galaxies.  In these ways I would know exactly
how much time had passed, no matter what you did here on Earth."

Ah.  And suppose I snapped my fingers and caused all the stars and
galaxies to move into the appropriate positions for 2108?

"You'd be arrested for violating the laws of physics."

But suppose I did it anyway.

"Then, still, 100 years would not have passed."

How would you *know* they had not passed?

"Because I would remember that, one night before, it had still been
2008.  Though, realistically speaking, I would think it more likely
that it was my memory at fault, not the galaxies."

Now suppose I snapped my fingers, and caused *all* the atoms in the
universe to move into positions that would be appropriate for (one
probable quantum branch) of 2108.  Even the atoms in your brain.

Think carefully before you say, "It would still *really* be 2008." 
For does this belief of yours, have *any*
[observable consequences](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/making-beliefs-.html)
left?  Or is it an
[epiphenomenon of your model of physics](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/relative-config.html)? 
*Where* is stored the fact that it is 'still 2008'?  Can I snap my
fingers one last time, and alter this last variable, and cause it
to *really*be 2108?

Is it possible that Cthulhu could snap Its tentacles, and cause
time *for the whole universe* to be suspended for exactly 10
million years, and then resume?  How would anyone ever detect what
had just happened?

A global suspension of time may seem *imaginable*, in the same way
that it seems imaginable that you could
"[move all the matter in the whole universe ten meters to the left](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/machs-principle.html)". 
To visualize the universe moving ten meters to the left, you
imagine a little swirling ball of galaxies, and then it jerks
leftward.  Similarly, to imagine time stopping, you visualize a
swirling ball of galaxies, and then it stops swirling, and hangs
motionless for a while, and then starts up again.

But the sensation of passing time, in your visualization, is
provided by your own mind's eye outside the system.  *You*go on
thinking, your brain's neurons firing, while, in your
*imagination*, the swirling ball of galaxies stays motionless.

When you *imagine* the universe moving ten meters to the left, you
are imagining motion *relative*to your mind's eye outside the
universe.  In the same way, when you imagine time stopping, you are
*imagining* a motionless universe, frozen *relative* to a
still-moving clock hidden outside: your own mind, counting the
seconds of the freeze.

But what would it mean for 10 million "years" to pass, if motion
*everywhere* had been suspended?

Does it make sense to say that the global rate of motion could slow
down, or speed up, over the whole universe at once - so that all
the particles arrive at the same final configuration, in twice as
much time, or half as much time?  You couldn't measure it with any
clock, because the ticking of the clock would slow down too.

Do not say, "I could not detect it; therefore, who knows, it might
happen every day."

Say rather, "I could not detect it, nor could anyone detect it even
in principle, nor would any physical relation be affected *except*
this one thing called 'the global rate of motion'.  Therefore, I
wonder what the phrase 'global rate of motion' really *means*."

All of that was a line of argument of Julian Barbour's, more or
less,  Let us pause here, and consider a second line of argument,
this one my own.  That is, I don't think it was in Barbour's
*The End of Time.*  (If I recall correctly, I reasoned thus even
before I read Barbour, while I was coming up with my
[unpublished general decision theory of Newcomblike problems](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/newcombs-proble.html). 
Of course that does not mean the argument is novel; I have no idea
whether it is novel.  But if my argument is wrong, I do not want it
blamed on an innocent bystander.)  So:

> "The future changes as we stand here, else we are the game pieces
> of the gods, not their heirs, as we have been promised."  
>         -- Raistlin Majere

A fine sentiment; but what does it mean to *change* the future?

Suppose I have a lamp, with an old-style compact fluorescent bulb
that takes a few seconds to warm up.  At 7:00am, the lamp is off. 
At 7:01am, I flip the switch; the lamp flickers for a few moments,
then begins to warm up.  At 7:02am, the lamp is fully bright. 
Between 7:00am and 7:02am, the lamp changed from OFF to ON.  This,
certainly, is a change; but it is a change *over time.*

Change implies difference; difference implies comparison.  Here,
the two values being compared are (1) the state of "the lamp at
7:00am", which is OFF, and (2) the state of "the lamp at 7:02am",
which is ON.  So we say "the lamp" has *changed* from one time to
another.  At 7:00am, you wander by, and see the lamp is OFF; at
7:02am, you wander by, and see the lamp is ON.

But have you ever seen the *future* change from one time to
another?  Have you wandered by a lamp at exactly 7:02am, and seen
that it is OFF; then, a bit later, looked in again on the "the lamp
at exactly 7:02am", and discovered that it is now ON?

Naturally, we often *feel* like we are "changing the future". 
Logging on to your online bank account, you discover that your
credit card bill comes due tomorrow, and, for some reason, has not
been paid automatically.  *Imagining* the future-by-default -
extrapolating out the world as it would be without any further
actions - you see that the bill not being paid, and interest
charges accruing on your credit card.  So you pay the bill online. 
And now, *imagining* tomorrow, it seems to you that the interest
charges will not occur.  So at 1:00pm, you imagined a future in
which your credit card accrued interest charges, and at 1:02pm, you
imagined a future in which it did not.  And so your imagination of
the future changed, from one time to another.

As I
[remarked previously](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/reductionism.html): 
The way a belief
[feels from inside](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/algorithm-feels.html),
is that you seem to be
[looking straight at reality](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/mind-projection.html). 
When it actually *seems* that you're looking at a belief, as such,
you are really
[experiencing a belief about your beliefs](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/qualitatively-c.html).

When your *extrapolation* of the future changes, from one time to
another, it *feels*like the future itself is changing.  Yet you
have never *seen* the future change.  When you actually *get to*the
future, you only ever see one outcome.

How could a single moment of time, change from one time to
another?

I am not going to go into "free will" in today's blog post.  Except
to remark that if you have been reading Overcoming Bias all this
time, and you are currently agonizing about whether or not you
*really have free will,* instead of trying to
[understand where your own mind has become confused](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/dissolving-the.html)
and generated an
[impossible question](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/wrong-questions.html),
you should probably go back and read it all again.  For anyone who
is just now joining us... perhaps I shall discuss the issue
tomorrow.

Just remember Egan's Law:  *It all adds up to normality.*  Apples
didn't stop falling when Einstein disproved Newton's theory of
gravity, and anyone who jumped off a cliff would still go splat. 
Perhaps Time turns out to work differently than you thought; but
tomorrow still lies ahead of you, and your choices, and their
consequences.  I wouldn't advise reworking your moral philosophy
based on confusing arguments and strange-seeming physics, until
[the physics stops appearing strange](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/quantum-explana.html)
and the arguments
[no longer seem confusing](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/dissolving-the.html).

Now to physics we turn; and here I resume drawing my ideas from
Julian Barbour.

For the benefit of anyone who hasn't followed the series on quantum
mechanics, a very *very* quick summary:

-   In classical physics - the *mistaken* physics that was
    developed first historically, and matches human intuitions all
    *too* well - a particle is like a little billiard ball.  A particle
    is in a single place in 3D space, and we can describe its position
    with three real numbers.  In *quantum* physics, we need an
    *amplitude distribution* over all possible positions for the
    particle - a complex number for the particle being *here,* a
    complex number for the particle being *there,* and so on through
    all the positions in space; a continuous distribution. 
    ([Configurations and Amplitude.](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/configurations.html))
-   In classical physics, we can consider each particle
    independently.  *This* particle is *here,* *that* particle is
    *there*.  In quantum physics this is not possible; we can only
    assign amplitudes to *configurations* that describe the
    simultaneous positions of many particles.  In fact, the only
    mathematical entities that actually have amplitudes are joint
    configurations of all the particles in the entire universe. 
    ([Joint Configurations.](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/joint-configura.html))

[![Jbarbourconfigurationcube\_3](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourconfigurationcube_3.png "Jbarbourconfigurationcube_3")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourconfigurationcube_3.png)

Above is a diagram that shows what a *configuration space* might
look like for three particles, A, B, and C.  ABC form a triangle in
two-dimensional space.  Every individual point in the configuration
space corresponds to a simultaneous position of *all* the particles
- above we see points that correspond to particular triangles i.e.
joint positions of A, B, and C. 
([Classical Configuration Spaces](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/conf-space.html);
[The Quantum Arena](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/quantum-arena.html).)

The *state of a quantum system* is not a *single point* in this
space; it is a *distribution* over this space.  You could imagine
it as a cloud, or a blob, or a colored mist within the space.

[![Jbarbourrelative](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourrelative.png "Jbarbourrelative")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourrelative.png)

Here we see a *relative* configuration space, in which each axis is
the distance between a pair of particles.  This has some advantages
I'm not going to recapitulate (it was covered in a
[previous post](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/relative-config.html)),
so if you're dropping into the middle of the series, just pretend
it's a regular configuration space.

[![Jbarbourtriangleland1](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtriangleland1.png "Jbarbourtriangleland1")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtriangleland1.png)

We've just chopped up the pyramidal space you saw before, into a
series of slices.  In this configuration space, the slices near the
bottom show all the particles close together (tiny triangles).  As
we rise up, the particles get further apart (larger triangles).

At the very bottom of the configuration space is a configuration
where all the particles occupy the same position.

(But remember, it's nonsense to talk about an *individual particle*
being anywhere in a *configuration space* - each point in the
configuration space corresponds to a position of all the
particles.  Configuration space is not the 3D space you know.  It's
not that there are a bunch of particles resting in the same place
at the bottom.  The single bottom point *corresponds to* all the
particles being in the same place in 3D space.)

[![Jbarbourtrianglecloud\_2](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtrianglecloud_2.png "Jbarbourtrianglecloud_2")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/jbarbourtrianglecloud_2.png)

Here we take a closer look at one of the slices of configuration
space, and see a cloud of blue and red mist covering some of it. 
(Why am I only showing the cloud covering a sixth (exactly a sixth)
of the triangle?  This has to do with a symmetry in the space -
exchanges of identical particles - which is not important to the
present discussion.)

But there is your glimpse of some quantum mist - in two colors,
because amplitudes are complex numbers with a real and imaginary
part.  An amplitude distribution or "wavefunction" assigns a
complex number to every point in the continuous configuration space
- a complex number to every possible configuration of all the
particles.

Yesterday, I finished by asking how the state of a quantum system
might evolve over *time.*

You might be tempted to visualize the mist churning and changing
colors, as quantum amplitude flows within the configuration space.

And this is *indeed* the way that you would visualize
*standard*physics.

Behold the standard Schrödinger Equation:

[![Schrodinger](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/schrodinger.gif "Schrodinger")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/26/schrodinger.gif)

Here *ψ*(**r**, *t*) is the amplitude distribution over
configuration space (**r**) and time (*t*).  The left-hand side of
the Schrödinger Equation is the *change over time* of the
wavefunction ψ, and the right-hand-side shows how to calculate this
change as the sum of two terms:  The gradient of the wavefunction
over configuration space (at that time), and the potential energy
of each configuration.

Which is to say, the derivative in *time* of the wavefunction - the
instantaneous rate of change - can be in terms of the
wavefunction's derivative in *space,* plus a term for the potential
energy.

If you tried to visualize Schrödinger's Equation - doesn't look too
hard, right? - you'd see a blob of churning, complex mist in
configuration space, with little blobs racing around and splitting
into smaller blobs as waves propagated.

If you tried to calculate the quantum state of a *single* hydrogen
atom *over time,* apart from the rest of the universe - which you
can only really do if the hydrogen atom
[isn't entangled with anything](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/decoherence.html)
- the atom's quantum state would evolve over time; the mist would
churn.

But suppose you think about the whole universe at once, including
yourself, of course.  Because - even in the standard model of
quantum physics! - that is exactly the arena in which quantum
physics takes place:  A wavefunction over *all* the particles,
*everywhere.*

If you can sensibly talk about the quantum state of some particular
hydrogen atom, it's only because the wavefunction happens to neatly
factor into (hydrogen atom) \* (rest of world).

Even if the hydrogen atom is behaving in a very regular way, the
*joint*wavefunction for (hydrogen atom \* rest of world) may not be
so regular.  Stars move into new positions, people are born and
people die, digital watches tick, and the cosmos expands:  The
universe is non-recurrent.

Think of how the *universal*wavefunction *ψ*(**r**, *t*) might
behave when **r** is the position of *all*the particles in the
universe.

Let's call 9:00am the time *t*=0, measured in seconds.

At *ψ*(**r**, *t*=0), then, you are wondering what time it is:  The
particles making up the neurons in your brain, are in positions
**r**~you~ that
[correspond to neurons firing in the thought-pattern](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/brain-breakthro.html)
"What time is it?"  And the Earth, and the Sun, and the rest of the
universe, have their own particles in the appropriate
**r**~rest-of-universe~.  Where the complete **r** roughly
factorizes as the product (**r**~you~ \* **r**~rest-of-universe~).

Over the next second, the joint wavefunction of the entire universe
evolves into *ψ*(**r**, *t*=1).  All the stars in the sky have
moved a little bit onward, in whatever direction they're heading;
the Sun has burned up a little more of its hydrogen; on Earth, an
average of 1.8 people have died; and you've just glanced down at
your watch.

At *ψ*(**r**, *t*=2), the stars have moved a little onward, the
galaxies have rotated, the cosmos has expanded a little more (and
its expansion has accelerated a little more), your watch has
evolved into the state of showing 9:00:02 AM on its screen, and
your own mind has evolved into the state of thinking the thought,
"Huh, I guess it's nine o' clock."

Ready for the next big simplification in physics?

Here it is:

We don't need the *t*.

It's redundant.

The **r** never repeats itself.  The universe is expanding, and in
every instant, it gets a little bigger.  We don't *need*a separate
*t* to keep things straight.  When you're looking at the whole
universe, a unique function *ψ* of (**r**, *t*) is pretty much a
unique function of **r**.

And the only way *we know in the first place* "what time it is", is
by looking at clocks.  And whether the clock is a wristwatch, or
the expansion of the universe, or *your own memories*, that clock
is encoded in the position of particles - in the **r**.  We have
never seen a *t* variable apart from the **r**.

[![Jbarbourrelative](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/27/jbarbourrelative.png "Jbarbourrelative")](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/27/jbarbourrelative.png)
We can recast the quantum wave equations, specifying the time
evolution of *ψ*(**r**, *t*), as specifying relations *within* a
wavefunction ψ(**r**).

Occam's Razor:  Our equations don't need a *t* in them, so we can
banish the *t* and make our ontology that much simpler.

An *unchanging* quantum mist hangs over the configuration space,
not churning, not flowing.

But the mist has internal structure, internal relations; and these
contain time *implicitly.*

The dynamics of physics - falling apples and rotating galaxies - is
now embodied *within* the unchanging mist in the unchanging
configuration space.

This landscape is not *frozen* like a cryonics patient suspended in
liquid nitrogen.  It is not motionless as an isolated system while
the rest of the universe goes on without it.

The landscape is *timeless*; time exists only *within* it.  To talk
about time, you have to talk about relations *inside*the
configuration space.

Asking "What happened before the Big Bang?" is revealed as a
*wrong question*.  There is no "before"; a "before" would be
outside the configuration space.  There was never a pre-existing
emptiness into which our universe exploded.  There is just this
timeless mathematical object, time existing *within* it; and the
object has a natural boundary at the Big Bang.  You cannot ask
"*When*did this mathematical object come into existence?" because
there is no *t* outside it.

So that is Julian Barbour's proposal for the next great
simplification project in physics.

(And yes, you can not only fit General Relativity into this
paradigm, it actually comes out looking
*even more elegant than before.*  For which point I refer you to
Julian Barbour's [papers](http://www.platonia.com/papers.html).)

Tomorrow, I'll go into some of my own thoughts and reactions to
this proposal.

But one point seems worth noting immediately:  I have spoken before
on the apparently
[perfect universality of physical laws](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/04/universal_law.html),
that apply everywhere and everywhen.  We have just raised this
perfection to an even higher pitch:
**everything that exists is either *perfectly global* or *perfectly local***. 
There are points in configuration space that affect only their
immediate neighbors in space and time; governed by universal laws
of physics.  Perfectly local, perfectly global.  If the meaning and
*sheer beauty* of this statement is not immediately obvious, I'll
go into it tomorrow.

And a final intuition-pump, in case you haven't yet gotten
timelessness on a gut level...

![Manybranches4](http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/27/manybranches4.png "Manybranches4")

Think of this as a diagram of the
[many worlds](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/05/many-worlds-one.html)
of quantum physics.  The branch points could be, say,
[your observation of a particle](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/on-being-decohe.html)
that seems to go either "left" or "right".

Looking back from the vantage point of the gold head, you only
*remember* having been the two green heads.

So you seem to remember Time proceeding along a *single line*.  You
remember that the particle first went left, and then went right. 
You ask, "Which way will the particle go *this*time?"

You only remember one of the two outcomes that occurred on each
occasion.  So you ask, "When I make my next observation, which of
the two possible worlds will *I* end up in?"

Remembering only a single line as your past, you try to extend that
line into the future -

But both branches, both future versions of you, just *exist.* 
There *is no fact of the matter* as to "which branch you go down". 
Different versions of you experience both branches.

So that is many-worlds.

And to incorporate Barbour, we simply say that all of these heads,
all these Nows, *just exist. *They do not appear and then vanish;
they just *are*.   From a global perspective, there *is no answer*
to the question, "What time is it?"  There are just different
experiences at different Nows.

From any given vantage point, you look back, and remember other
times - so that the question, "Why is it *this* time right now,
rather than some *other*time?" seems to make sense.  But there is
no answer.

When I came to this understanding, I forgot the meaning that Time
had once held for me.

Time has
[dissolved](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/dissolving-the.html)
for me, has been
[reduced](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/reductionism.html)
to something simpler that is not itself timeful.

I can no longer conceive that there might *really be* a universal
time, which is somehow "moving" from the past to the future.  This
now seems like nonsense.

Something like Barbour's timeless physics has to be true, or I'm in
trouble:  I have forgotten how to imagine a universe that has "real
genuine time" in it.
