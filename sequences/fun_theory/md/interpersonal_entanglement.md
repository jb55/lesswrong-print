# Interpersonal Entanglement

Today I shall criticize yet another Utopia.  This Utopia isn't
famous in the literature.  But it's considerably superior to many
better-known Utopias - more fun than the Christian Heaven, or Greg
Egan's upload societies, for example.  And so the main flaw is well
worth pointing out.

This Utopia consists of a one-line remark on an IRC channel:

> <reedspacer\> living in your volcano lair with catgirls is probably
> a vast increase in standard of living for most of humanity

I've come to think of this as Reedspacer's Lower Bound.

Sure, it sounds silly.  But if your grand vision of the future
isn't at *least*as much fun as a volcano lair with catpersons of
the appropriate gender, you should just go with that instead.  This
rules out a surprising number of proposals.

But today I am here to *criticize*Reedspacer's Lower Bound - the
problem being the catgirls.

I've joked about the subject, now and then - "Donate now, and get a
free catgirl or catboy after the Singularity!" - but I think it
would actually be a terrible idea.  In fact, today's post could
have been entitled "Why Fun Theorists Don't Believe In Catgirls."



I first realized that catpeople were a potential threat, at the
point when a friend said - quotes not verbatim -

"I want to spend a million years having sex with catgirls after the
Singularity."

I replied,

"No, you don't."

He said, "Yes I do."

I said, "No you don't.  You'd get bored."

He said, "Well, then I'd just modify my brain not to get bored -"

And I said:  "AAAAIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE"

Don't worry, the story has a happy ending.  A couple of years
later, the same friend came back and said:

"Okay, I've gotten a bit more mature now - it's a long story,
actually - and now I realize I wouldn't want to do that."

To which I sagely replied:

"*HA! **HA HA HA!*  You wanted to spend a *million years* having
sex with catgirls.  It only took you *two years* to change your
mind and you *didn't even have sex with any catgirls*."

Now, this *particular* case was probably about
[scope insensitivity](/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/), the
"[moment of hearing the good news](/lw/wv/prolegomena_to_a_theory_of_fun/)"
bias, and the
[emotional magnetism of specific fantasy](/lw/xp/seduced_by_imagination/).

But my *general*objection to catpeople - well, call me a
sentimental Luddite, but I'm worried about the prospect of
nonsentient romantic partners.

(Where "nonsentient romantic/sex partner" is pretty much what I use
the word "catgirl" to indicate, in futuristic discourse.  The
notion of creating *sentient* beings to staff a volcano lair, gets
us into a *whole*'nother class of
[objections](/lw/x5/nonsentient_optimizers/).  And as for existing
humans choosing to take on feline form, that seems to me scarcely
different from wearing lingerie.)

"But," you ask, "what *is* your objection to nonsentient lovers?"

In a nutshell - sex/romance, as we know it now, is a primary
dimension of multiplayer *fun.*  If you take that fun and redirect
it to something that isn't socially entangled, if you turn sex into
an exclusively single-player game, then you've just made life that
much simpler - in the same way that eliminating
[boredom](/lw/xr/in_praise_of_boredom/) or
[sympathy](/lw/xs/sympathetic_minds/) or
[values over nonsubjective reality](/lw/lb/not_for_the_sake_of_happiness_alone/)
or
[individuals wanting to navigate their own futures](/lw/xb/free_to_optimize/),
would tend to make life "simpler".  When I consider how easily
human existence could collapse into sterile simplicity, if just a
single major value were eliminated, I get very protective of the
*complexity* of human existence.

I ask it in all seriousness - is there *any* aspect of human
existence as complicated as romance?  Think twice before you say,
"Well, it doesn't seem all that complicated to *me;* now calculus,
on the other hand, that's complicated."  We are
[congenitally biased to underestimate the complexity of things that involve human intelligence](/lw/jp/occams_razor/),
because the complexity is obscured and simplified and swept under a
rug.  Interpersonal relationships involve *brains,* still the most
complicated damn things around.  And among interpersonal
relationships, love is (at least potentially) more complex than
being nice to your friends and kin, negotiating with your allies,
or outsmarting your enemies.  Aspects of all three, really.  And
that's not merely having a utility function over the other mind's
state - thanks to [sympathy](/lw/xs/sympathetic_minds/), we get
tangled up with that other mind.  Smile when the one smiles, wince
when the one winces.

If you delete the intricacy of human romantic/sexual relationships
between sentient partners - then the peak complexity of the human
species goes down.  The most complex fun thing you can do, has its
pleasure surgically detached and redirected to something simpler.

I'd call that a major step in the wrong direction.

Mind you... we've got to do *something* about, you know, the
problem.

Anyone the least bit familiar with evolutionary psychology knows
that the complexity of human relationships, directly reflects the
incredible complexity of the interlocking selection pressures
involved.  Males and females do need each other to reproduce, but
there are huge conflicts of reproductive interest between the
sexes.  I don't mean to go into Evolutionary Psychology 101 (Robert
Wright's *The Moral Animal* is one popular book), but e.g. a woman
must always invest nine months of work into a baby and usually much
more to raise it, where a man might invest only a few minutes; but
among humans significant paternal investments are quite common, yet
a woman is always certain of maternity where a man is uncertain of
paternity... which creates an incentive for the woman to
surreptitiously seek out better genes...
[none of this is conscious or even subconscious](/lw/l1/evolutionary_psychology/),
it's just the selection pressures that helped construct our
particular emotions and attractions.

And as the upshot of all these huge conflicts of reproductive
interest...

Well, men and women do still need each other to reproduce.  So we
are still built to be attracted to each other.  We don't actually
flee screaming into the night.

But men are not optimized to make women happy, and women are not
optimized to make men happy.  The vast majority of men are not what
the vast majority of women would *most*prefer, or vice versa.  I
don't know if anyone has ever actually done this study, but I bet
that both gay and lesbian couples are happier on average with their
relationship than heterosexual couples.  (Googles... yep,
[looks like it](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Gay-and-Lesbian-Families-Are-Happier-than-Heterosexual-Ones-77094.shtml).)

I find it all too easy to imagine a world in which men retreat to
their optimized sweet sexy catgirls, and women retreat to their
optimized darkly gentle catboys, and neither sex has anything to do
with each other ever again.  Maybe men would take the east side of
the galaxy and women would take the west side.  And the two new
intelligent species, and their romantic sexbots, would go their
separate ways from there.

That strikes me as kind of sad.

Our species does definitely have a problem.  If you've managed to
find your perfect mate, then I *am*glad for you, but *try*to have
some sympathy on the rest of your poor species - they *aren't* just
incompetent.  Not all women and men are the same, no, not at all. 
But if you drew two histograms of the desired frequencies of
intercourse for both sexes, you'd see that the graphs don't match
up, and it would be the same way on many other dimensions.  There
*can*be lucky couples, and every person considered individually,
probably has an individual soulmate out there somewhere... if you
don't consider the *competition*.  Our species *as a whole* has a
statistical sex problem!

But splitting in two and generating optimized nonsentient
romantic/sexual partner(s) for both halves, doesn't strike me as
*solving* the problem so much as running away from it.  There
should be superior alternatives.  I'm willing to bet that a few
psychological nudges in both sexes - to behavior and/or desire -
could solve 90% of the needlessly frustrating aspects of
relationships for large sectors of the population, while still
keeping the complexity and interest of loving someone who isn't
*tailored*to your desires.

Admittedly, I might be prejudiced.  For myself, I would like
humankind to stay together and not yet splinter into separate
shards of diversity, at least for the short range that my own
mortal eyes can envision.  But I can't quite manage to argue...
that such a wish should be binding on someone who doesn't have it.
