## Minor Sequences

> Smaller collections of posts. Usually parts of major sequences which depend on some-but-not-all of the points introduced.

### Map and Territory

> A collection of introductory posts dealing with the fundamentals of
> rationality: the difference between the map and the territory, Bayes's Theorem
> and the nature of evidence, why anyone should care about truth, minds as
> reflective cognitive engines...

*Note: The Bayes's Theorem article was intentionally left out of this sequence,
it deserves its own*
