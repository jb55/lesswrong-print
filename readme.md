## Major Sequences

### Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions

> How to see through the many disguises of answers or beliefs or statements,
> that don't answer or say or mean anything. The first (and probably most
> important) core sequence on Less Wrong.

### Reductionism

> The second core sequence of Less Wrong. How to take reality apart into
> pieces... and live in that universe, where we have always lived, without
> feeling disappointed about the fact that complicated things are made of
> simpler things.

Includes the 'Zombies' and 'Joy in the Merely Real' subsequences

### Quantum Physics

> A non-mysterious introduction to quantum mechanics, intended to be accessible
> to anyone who can grok algebra and complex numbers. Cleaning up the old
> confusion about QM is used to introduce basic issues in rationality (such as
> the technical version of Occam's Razor), epistemology, reductionism,
> naturalism, and philosophy of science. Not dispensable reading, even though
> the exact reasons for the digression are hard to explain in advance of
> reading.

### Fun Theory

> A concrete theory of transhuman values. How much fun is there in the universe;
> will we ever run out of fun; are we having fun yet; could we be having more
> fun. Part of the complexity of value thesis. Also forms part of the fully
> general answer to religious theodicy.

## Minor Sequences

> Smaller collections of posts. Usually parts of major sequences which depend on some-but-not-all of the points introduced.

### Map and Territory

> A collection of introductory posts dealing with the fundamentals of
> rationality: the difference between the map and the territory, Bayes's Theorem
> and the nature of evidence, why anyone should care about truth, minds as
> reflective cognitive engines...

Note: The Bayes's Theorem article was intentionally left out of this sequence,
it deserves its own
